<p>4 STATIC STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Structural analysis is probably the most common application of the
finite element method. The term structural (or structure) implies not only civil
engineering structures such as bridges and buildings, but also naval,
aeronautical and mechanical structures such as ship hulls, aircraft bodies, and
machine housings, as well as mechanical components such as pistons,
machine parts and tools.
Types of Structural Analysis
The following types of structural analyses can be performed using
ANSYS:
 Static Analysis -- Used to determine displacements, stresses, etc. under
static loading conditions, both linear and nonlinear static analyses.
Nonlinearities can include plasticity, stress stiffening, large deflection,
large strain, hyperelasticity, contact surfaces and creep.
 Modal Analysis -- Used to calculate the natural frequencies and mode
shapes of a structure. Several mode-extraction methods are available.
 Harmonic Analysis -- Used to determine the response of a structure to
harmonically time-varying loads.
 Transient Dynamic Analysis -- Used to determine the response of a
structure to arbitrarily time-varying loads. All nonlinearities mentioned
under Static Analysis above are allowed.
 Spectrum Analysis -- An extension of the modal analysis, used to
calculate stresses and strains due to a response spectrum or a PSD
input (random vibrations).
 Buckling Analysis -- Used to calculate the buckling loads and determine
the buckling mode shape. Both linear (eigenvalue) buckling and
nonlinear buckling analyses are possible.
 Explicit Dynamic Analysis -- This type of structural analysis is available
via the ANSYS LS-DYNA product, which provides an interface to the LS-
DYNA explicit finite element program. Explicit dynamic analysis
calculates fast solutions for large deformation dynamics and complex
contact problems.
The primary unknowns (nodal degrees of freedom) calculated in a
structural analysis are displacements. Other quantities such as strains,
stresses and reaction forces are then derived from the nodal displacements.
Selecting Elements

2

Most element types are structural elements, ranging from simple spars
and beams to more complex layered shells and large strain solids. Most types
of structural analyses can use any of these elements.
Selecting Material Models
For analyses described in this book, the analyst must specify the
material that s/he intends to simulate. Using the GUI, the analyst can specify
many materials that s/he intends to simulate via an intuitive material model
interface. The interface uses a hierarchical tree structure of material
categories, intended to assist in choosing the appropriate model for the
analysis.
Solution Method
The ANSYS family of products uses the h-method for solving structural
problems. The h-method can be used for any type of analysis.
Static Analysis
A static analysis calculates the effects of steady loading conditions on a
structure, while ignoring inertia and damping effects, such as those caused by
time-varying loads. A static analysis can, however, include steady inertia loads
and time-varying loads that can be approximated as static equivalent loads.
Static analysis determines the displacements, stresses, strains, and
forces in structures or components caused by loads that do not induce
significant inertia and damping effects. Steady loading and response
conditions are assumed; that is, the loads and the structure&#39;s response are
assumed to vary slowly with respect to time. The types of loading that can be
applied in a static analysis include:
 Externally applied forces and pressures
 Steady-state inertial forces
 Imposed displacements
 Temperatures
 Fluences.
Linear vs. Nonlinear Static Analyses
A static analysis can be either linear or nonlinear. All types of
nonlinearities are allowed - large deformations, plasticity, creep, stress
stiffening, contact elements, hyperelastic elements and so on. This section
focuses on linear static analyses, with brief references to nonlinearities.

3
Performing a Static Analysis
Build the Model
Keep the following points in mind when doing a static analysis:
 Both linear and nonlinear structural elements can be used
 Material properties can be linear or nonlinear, isotropic or
orthotropic and constant or temperature-dependent
 Define stiffness in some form
 For inertia loads, define the data required for mass calculations,
such as density
 For thermal loads, define the coefficient of thermal expansion.
Note the following information about mesh density:
 Regions where stresses or strains vary rapidly require a relatively
finer mesh than regions where stresses or strains are nearly
constant.
 While considering the influence of nonlinearities, remember that
the mesh should be able to capture the effects of the
nonlinearities. For example, plasticity requires a reasonable
integration point density in areas with high plastic deformation
gradients.
Set Solution Controls
Setting solution controls involves defining the analysis type and
common analysis options for an analysis, as well as specifying load step
options for it. Take advantage of a streamlined solution interface when
performing a structural static analysis. The Solution Controls dialog box
(Main Menu&gt; Solution&gt; Analysis Type&gt; Sol&#39;n Controls) provides
default settings that will work well for many structural static analyses. It is
necessary to set only a few of the options. Because the streamlined solution
interface is the recommended tool for setting solution controls in a structural
static analysis, it is the method that is presented in this section. Solution
controls for the analysis can also be set using the menu paths (Main
Menu&gt; Solution&gt; Unabridged Menu&gt; option).
Apply the Loads
After the desired solution options are set, apply loads to the model.
The load types applicable in a static analysis are Displacements, Velocities,
Forces, Moments, Pressures, Temperatures, Fluences, Gravity, Spinning, etc.

4

Except for inertia and velocity loads, the analyst can define loads either
on the solid model or on the finite element model. S/he can also apply
boundary conditions via TABLE type array parameters or as function
boundary conditions.
Loads can also be applied using TABLE type array parameters. In a
structural analysis, valid primary variables are TIME, TEMP, and location (X,
Y, Z). When defining the table, TIME must be in ascending order in the table
index (as in any table array).
Solve the Analysis
ANSYS is now ready to solve the problem.
1. Save a backup copy of the database to a named file (Utility Menu&gt;
File&gt; Save as). Then retrieve the model by reentering the ANSYS
program and issuing RESUME.
2. Start solution calculations (Main Menu&gt; Solution&gt; Solve&gt; Current
LS).
3. If it is necessary to include additional loading conditions (that is,
multiple load steps), repeat the process of applying loads, specifying
load step options, saving, and solving for each load step.
4. Leave SOLUTION. Close the Solution menu.
Review the Results
Results from a static analysis are written to the structural results
file, Jobname.RST. They consist of the following data:
 Primary data: Nodal displacements (UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ)
 Derived data: Nodal and element stresses, Nodal and element strains,
Element forces, Nodal reaction forces and so on.
Postprocessors
These results can be viewed using POST1, the general postprocessor,
and POST26, the time-history processor.
 POST1 is used to review results over the entire model at specific
sub-steps (time-points). Some typical POST1 operations are
explained below.
 POST26 is used in nonlinear static analyses to track specific result
items over the applied load history.

Reviewing Results Data

1. Read in the database from the database file using Utility Menu&gt;
File&gt; Resume from
2. Read in the desired set of results. Identify the data set by load step
and substep numbers or by time. If a time value is specified for
which no results are available, the ANSYS program will perform linear
interpolation on all the data to calculate the results at that time.

3. Perform the necessary POST1 operations. Typical static analysis
POST1 operations are explained below.
Postprocessing Operations
 Use Main Menu&gt; General Postproc&gt; Plot Results&gt; Deformed

The sum of all nodal forces and moments for a selected set of nodes
can be listed. Select a set of nodes and use this feature to find out the total
force acting on those nodes using Main Menu&gt; General Postproc&gt; Nodal

The total force and total moment at each selected node can also be
checked. For a body in equilibrium, the total load is zero at all nodes except
where an applied load or reaction load exists: Main Menu&gt; General

W6: A tower is made up of trusses. The four trusses at the top are each 2m
in length. The cross section of each of the truss members is 6.25e-
3sq.m. Assume the structure is made of steel with modulus of elasticity
E=200GPa. The tower is constrained along X and Y directions at the
bottom left corner, and along Y direction at the bottom right corner.
The tower is loaded at the top. The load is in vertical direction only,
and its magnitude is 4000N. Determine deflection at each joint.
Determine stress in each member. Determine reaction forces at the
base.

Data: Height of each truss=2m, cross sectional area=6.25e-3sq.m.,
E=2e11N/m 2 , Load=-4000N
Sol: A truss is a structural element that experiences loading only in the axial
direction. In this example a 2-D Truss element will be used. A power

24

transmission tower is a common example of a structure that is made
up of only truss members. These towers are actually 3-D structures,
but for the sake of simplicity a cross-sectional face of the tower will be
taken. The tower is mainly subjected to loading in the vertical direction
due to the weight of the cables. Also it is subjected to forces due to
wind. In this example only loading due to the weight of the cables,
which is in the vertical direction, will be considered.

4. Define element table items for subsequent plotting and listing of various
stress results. For line elements, such as beam elements, to generate certain
stress results, define an element table, using the ETABLE command. Note
that each element is defined by two end nodes, denoted by node i and node
j. Node i is the first of the two nodes defined when the element was created.
The form of the GUI path to define a table containing the shear force, at
node i, for each element, is:
Main Menu&gt; General Postproc&gt; Element Table&gt; Define Table&gt; Add
SFy for user label, Select By sequence num and SMISC, 5, click Apply
SFy for user label, Select By sequence num and SMISC, 18, click ‘OK’
Now plot shear force diagram.
General Postproc&gt; Plot Results&gt; Contour Plot&gt; Line Ele Res
Enter LabI=SMIS5, LabJ=SMIS18
The entries in this command pertain specifically to the BEAM188 element.
In the command above, ‘SFyI’ is simply a label chosen by the user.
Practically any other text string could be used in this field. However, it must
not have more than eight characters, and it cannot be identical to any
general ANSYS predefined label. ‘SMISC’ is the appropriate item for shear
force in BEAM188 elements. Also, the ‘5’ shown as the last entry is correct
sequence number on the ETABLE command, assuming BEAM188 elements
are used, and the user wants to store the bending stresses, at node i for each
element.

38

If the user also wants to define an element table in which the bending
moment, at node j for each element is stored, the command that could be
used is similar to that above. However, the user should choose a different
identifying label ‘My’, and the value of the last entry for this case is ‘2 and
15’.
Main Menu&gt; General Postproc&gt; Element Table&gt; Define Table&gt; Add
BMzI for user label, Select By sequence num and SMISC, 2, click ‘Apply’
SFyJ for user label, Select By sequence num and SMISC, 15, click ‘OK’
Now plot bendind moment diagram.
General Postproc&gt; Plot Results&gt; Contour Plot&gt; Line Ele Res
Enter LabI=SMIS2, LabJ=SMIS15

5. List element table results. Assuming all four of the above ETABLE commands
were entered, then a listing of each stored stress component can be
obtained with the menu path:
General Postproc&gt; List Results&gt; Elem Table Data
Then, highlight the desired labels, and click on ‘OK’. The stresses
corresponding to the chosen labels will be listed by element number.

In the dialogue box that opens, select the label ‘MzI’ for the LABI entry, and

if desired, and the user can choose whether or not to include on the plot
either ‘Deformed Shape Only’, ‘Deformed + Undeformed’, or ‘Deformed +
Undeformed Edge’.
Of course, the other component labels could be chosen instead, if
desired.

is the first of the two nodes defined when the element was created. The
form of the GUI path to define a table containing the shear force at the ‘top’
of the beam, at node i, for each element, is
Main Menu&gt; General Postproc&gt; Element Table&gt; Define Table&gt; Add
SFy for user label, Select By sequence num and SMISC, 6, click Apply

Now plot shear force diagram.
General Postproc&gt; Plot Results&gt; Contour Plot&gt; Line Ele Res
Enter LabI=SMIS5, LabJ=SMIS18
The entries in this command pertain specifically to the BEAM188 element.
In the command above, ‘SFyI’ is simply a label chosen by the user.
Practically any other text string could be used in this field. However, it must
not have more than eight characters, and it cannot be identical to any

general ANSYS predefined label. ‘SMISC’ is the appropriate item for shear
force in BEAM188 elements. Also, the ‘5’ shown as the last entry is correct
sequence number on the ETABLE command, assuming BEAM188 elements
are used, and the user wants to store the bending stresses at the top of the
beam elements, at node i for each element.
If the user also wants to define an element table in which the bending stress
at the top of each beam element, at node j for each element is stored, the
command that could be used is similar to that above. However, the user
should choose a different identifying label, and the value of the last entry for
this case is ‘3’. For instance,
As additional examples, to store the bending stress at the bottom of the
beam elements, at node i for each element, and to store the bending stress
at the bottom of the beam elements, at node j for each element, the
commands are,

element. For this example, extract the stresses from the I and J nodes
of each element. These are the nodes that are at the ends of each
element.

If the user also wants to define an element table in which the bending

The p-level was advanced uniformly from 2 to 3 throughout the

Using the default convergence criteria gives a noticeable discontinuity
in stress contours across element boundaries indicating poor accuracy
in the computed stresses, and the total strain energy looks as though it
would continue change if the p-levels were incremented.  To increase
the accuracy, we will employ a different convergence criteria and solve
the problem again.

63

The quantity of interest here is the maximum stress in the vicinity of
the hole, therefore we require that the solution be repeated with
increasing p-levels used for the elements until the calculated maximum
stress stops changing to within some required tolerance, say 1%.

The smoothness of these stress contours gives us confidence in the
solution.  The p-level distribution in the mesh is shown next.

To obtain the requested accuracy, it was necessary to use p-levels of 5
in most of the elements.  The convergence history of Sx at the
specified node is shown next.

64

The Sx stress component at the hole is seen to converge nicely to a value in
which  the analyst can have confidence.  Notice that the maximum p-level
available for these elements in ANSYS is 8.  If using p-levels of 8 does not
provide the requested accuracy, a more refined mesh must first be created
and the problem solved again.
W16: Mesh the quadrant of a plate to illustrate using the default settings to

The large differences in stress contour plots across element boundaries
indicates unacceptable accuracy in the results. First remove the loads

To refine the mesh selectively,

the point of highest stress.)

Local refinement then produces the following mesh.
Now apply displacement and pressure boundary conditions to the new
mesh.  Solution then gives the Sigma-x plot shown next.

The stress contours are much smoother than those from the first
mesh.   The process may be repeated to obtain further accuracy.

this mesh and element.
4.Clear the mesh (Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Clear&gt; Areas) and remesh
with 4 elements per edge to improve the accuracy. Then repeat with 8
elements per edge. Observe that the last mesh produces deflection
with an error of only 1.1 %. The von Mises stress plot for this case is
shown below.

The stress contours are now much smoother in comparison with the
first mesh. (Since the stresses are proportional to the spatial
derivatives of the displacements, the stresses generally have
greater error than the displacements.)
Increase the mesh density or switch to the eight node SHELL281
element, or do both to obtain yet greater accuracy for this problem.

Define the vertices of the frame using variables. These variables
represent the various lengths of the bicycle members. By using
variables like this, it is very easy to set up a parametric description of
the model. This will enable quickly redefining the frame should
changes be necessary. The quickest way to enter these variables is via
the &#39;ANSYS Input&#39; window. Type in each of the following lines followed
by Enter.
X1 = 325, X2 = 825, Y1 = 125, Y2 = 325, Y3=400, Z1 = 25
