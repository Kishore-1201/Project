<p>3 MODELING AND MESHING

3.1 Model Generation
The function of a finite element analysis is to rebuild mathematically the
behavior of a real engineering system. The analysis must be a precise
mathematical model of the system. This model comprises the nodes, elements,
material properties, real constants, boundary conditions, and other features that
are used to represent the physical system.
3.1.1 What Is Model Generation?
Model generation usually takes on the narrower meaning of generating
the nodes and elements that represent the spatial volume and connectivity of the
real system. Thus, model generation involves the process of defining the
geometric configuration of the model&#39;s nodes and elements.  ANSYS offers the
following approaches to model generation:
 Creating a solid model using ANSYS
 Using direct generation
 Importing a model created in a computer-aided design (CAD) system.
3.1.2 Steps Involved in Model Generation
A general modeling session might follow this common outline:
 Start by planning the approach. Find out the objectives, choose what
basic form the model will take, decide appropriate element types, and
consider how to set up an appropriate mesh density. Carryout general
planning before initiating the session.
 Enter the preprocessor (PREP7) to begin the model-building session.
Most often, the model is built using solid modeling procedures.
 Establish a working plane.
 Create basic geometric features using geometric
primitives and Boolean operators.
 Activate the suitable coordinate system.
 Generate other solid model features from the bottom up. That is,
create keypoints, and then define lines, areas, and volumes as
needed.

2

 Employ more Boolean operators or number controls to join separate
solid model regions together as appropriate.
 Create tables of element attributes.
 Set element attribute pointers.
 Set meshing controls to set up the desired mesh density if desired.
This step is not always required because default element sizes exist.
 Generate nodes and elements by meshing the solid model.
 After nodes and elements are generated, add features such
as surface-to-surface contact elements, coupled degrees of freedom,
and constraint equations.
 Save the model data to Jobname.DB.
 Exit the preprocessor.
3.1.3 Solid Modeling Vs Direct Generation
Two different methods can be used to generate the model: solid
modeling and direct generation. With solid modeling, describe the geometric
boundaries of the model, establish controls over the size and desired shape of
the elements, and then instruct the ANSYS program to generate the nodes and
elements automatically. In the direct generation method, the analyst determines
the location of every node and the size, shape, and connectivity of every element
prior to defining these entities.
The direct generation method is essentially a hands-on, ‘manual’ method
that requires to keep track of all the node numbers as the finite element mesh is
developed. This detailed accounting can become tiresome for large models,
leading to the potential for modeling errors. Solid modeling is usually more
dominant and flexible than direct generation, and is by and large the preferred
choice for generating the model.
The relative advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches are
listed here.
Solid Modeling
On the optimistic side, solid modelling is generally more apt for large or
complex models, especially 3-D models. This method permits to work with a
comparatively small number of entities and permits geometric operations that
cannot be completed with nodes and elements. It supports the use of ‘primitive’
areas and volumes. It also facilitates Boolean operations for ‘top down’
construction and readily permits modifications to geometry.

3

However, solid modelling can necessitate large amounts of system time. It
can be more taxing, requiring more data entries than direct generation and can
‘fail’ under certain situations.
Direct Generation
On the positive side, direct generation is handy for small or simple
models. It offers complete control over the geometry and numbering of every
node and every element.
However, direct generation is usually more time consuming; the volume of
data one must work with can become vast. It cannot be used with adaptive
meshing. Direct generation can become monotonous, requiring the analyst to
pay more concentration to every detail of the mesh.
3.1.4 Importing Solid Models Created in CAD systems
Instead of generating the solid models using ANSYS, the analyst can
produce them in her/his favorite CAD system and then import them into ANSYS,
by saving them in the IGES file format. ANSYS comes with IGES support by
default. There are Geometry Interfaces available for Pro/E, CATIA, UG,
Solidworks, Parasolid, etc. All of these geometry interfaces on the ANSYS
Traditional side perform a conversion of the geometry into an ANSYS Neutral File
(.anf) format, which it then reads in.
Import CAD geometry using ‘File &gt; Import’. Models imported from CAD
systems may require general repair if they are not of appropriate quality.
Generating a model using a CAD package has the following advantages:
 Repetition of effort can be avoided by using existing CAD models to
produce solid models for analysis.
 More familiar tools can be used to create models.
3.2 Planning the Approach
As the analyst begins to create the model, s/he will make a number of
decisions that determine how the real system will be simulated mathematically.
For example: What are the objectives of the analysis? Will s/he model all, or just
a portion, of the real system? How much detail will be included in the model?
What kinds of elements will be used? How dense should the finite element mesh
be?

4

An attempt will be made to balance computational expense against
precision of results. The decisions made in the planning stage of the analysis will
mainly decide the success or failure of the analysis.
This first step of the analysis depends not on the capabilities in the ANSYS
program, but on knowledge, experience, and professional expertize of the
analyst. Only s/he can determine what the objectives must be. The objectives
established at the start will control the rest of the choices as the model is
created.
3.2.1 Choosing a Model Type
The ANSYS model may be categorized as 2-D or 3-D, and as composed of
point elements, line elements, area elements, or solid elements. Of course, the
analyst can mix different kinds of elements (Fig. 3.1) as required. For example,
the analyst might model a stiffened shell structure using 3-D shell elements to
represent the skin and 3-D beam elements to represent the ribs.

Fig. 3.1 Different types of elements

LINE models can represent 2-D or 3-D beam or pipe structures, as well as
2-D models of 3-D axisymmetric shell structures. Solid modeling usually does not
offer much benefit for generating line models; they are more often created by
direct generation methods.
2-D SOLID analysis models are used for thin planar structures (plane
stress), ‘infinitely long’ structures having a constant cross section (plane strain),
or axisymmetric solid structures. Although many 2-D analysis models are
relatively easy to create by direct generation methods, they are usually easier to
create with solid modeling.

5

3-D SHELL models are used for thin structures in 3-D space. Although
some 3-D shell analysis models are relatively easy to create by direct generation
methods, they are usually easier to create with solid modeling.
3-D SOLID analysis models are used for thick structures in 3-D space that
have neither a constant cross section nor an axis of symmetry. Creating a 3-D
solid analysis model by direct generation methods usually requires considerable
effort. Solid modeling will nearly always make the job easier.

3.2.2 Choosing Between Linear and Higher Order Elements
The ANSYS program&#39;s element library includes two basic types of area and
volume elements: linear  and quadratic. These basic element types are
represented schematically in Fig. 3.2. Look at some of the points involved in
selecting between these two basic element types:

(a) Linear isoparametric (b) Linear isoparametric with extra shapes

(c) Quadratic

Fig. 3.2  Area and Volume Types

3.2.2.1 Linear Elements
For structural analyses, the corner node elements with extra shape
functions will often yield an accurate solution. When using these elements, it is
essential to avoid their degenerate forms. That is, avoid using the triangular form
of 2-D linear elements and the wedge or tetrahedral forms of 3-D linear
elements. Also take care to avoid using excessively distorted linear elements.
In nonlinear structural analyses, better accuracy can be obtained at less cost by

6

using a fine mesh rather than a comparable coarse mesh of quadratic elements.
Examples of (a) linear and (b) quadratic elements are shown in Fig. 3.3.

Fig. 3.3 Comparable Grids

When modeling a curved shell, choose between using curved or flat shell
elements. Each option has its own pros and cons. The majority of problems can
be solved to a high degree of accuracy in a minimum amount of computer time
with flat elements. Take care to ensure that enough flat elements are used to
model the curved surface satisfactorily. Obviously, the smaller the element, the
higher will be the accuracy.
For most non-structural analyses, the linear elements are nearly as good
as the higher order elements, and are less expensive to use. Degenerate
elements usually produce accurate results in non-structural analyses.
3.2.2.2 Quadratic Elements (Mid-side Nodes)
For linear structural analyses with degenerate element shapes, the
quadratic elements will usually give better results at less expense than will the
linear elements.
3.3 Coordinate Systems
The ANSYS program uses several types of coordinate systems, each used
for a different purpose:
 Global  and local coordinate systems are used to locate geometry items in
space.
 The display coordinate system determines the system in which geometry
items are listed or displayed.
 The nodal coordinate system defines the degree of freedom directions at
each node and the orientation of nodal results data.
 The element coordinate system determines the orientation of material
properties and element results data.

7

 The results coordinate system is used to convert nodal or element results
data to a particular coordinate system for listings, displays, or general
postprocessing operations (POST1).
The working plane, which is separate from the coordinate systems, is for
locating geometric primitives during the modeling process.
3.3.1 Global and Local Coordinate Systems
Global and local coordinate systems are used to locate geometry items.
When a node or a keypoint is defined, its coordinates are interpreted in the
global Cartesian system by default. For some models, however, it may be more
convenient to define the coordinates in a system other than global Cartesian.
Input the geometry in any of three predefined (global) coordinate systems, or in
any number of user defined (local) coordinate systems.
3.3.1.1 Global Coordinate Systems
A global coordinate system (Fig. 3.4) can be thought of as an absolute
reference frame. Three predefined global systems are available: Cartesian,
cylindrical, and spherical. All three of these systems are right-handed and, by
definition, share the same origin. They are identified by their coordinate system
(CS) numbers: 0 for Cartesian, 1 and 5 for cylindrical, and 2 for spherical.

(a) Cartesian (X, Y, Z components) coordinate system 0 (C.S.0)
(b) Cylindrical (R, θ, Z components) coordinate system 1 (C.S.1)
(c) Spherical (R, θ, φ components) coordinate system 2 (C.S.2)
(d) Cylindrical (R, θ, Y components) coordinate system 5 (C.S.5)

Fig. 3.4  Global Coordinate Systems

3.3.1.2  Local Coordinate Systems
In many cases, it may be necessary to establish own coordinate system,
whose origin is offset from the global origin, or whose orientation differs from
that of the predefined global systems. Such user defined coordinate systems,
known as local coordinate systems, can be created in the following ways:

8

 Use  Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Local Coordinate Systems&gt; Create
Local CS&gt; At Specified Loc to define the local system in terms of global
Cartesian coordinates.
 Use  Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Local Coordinate Systems&gt; Create
Local CS&gt; By 3 Nodes to define the local system in terms of existing
nodes.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Local Coordinate Systems&gt; Create
Local CS&gt; By 3 Keypoints to define the local system in terms of existing
keypoints.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Local Coordinate Systems&gt; Create
Local CS&gt; At WP Origin to define the local system to be centered at the
origin of the presently defined working plane.
When a local coordinate system is defined, it becomes the active
coordinate system. As a local system is created, assign it a CS identification
number (which must be 11 or greater). Local coordinate systems can be created
or deleted in any phase of the ANSYS session. Use Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt;
Local Coordinate Systems&gt; Delete Local CS to delete a local system. Use Utility
Menu&gt; List&gt; Other&gt; Local Coord Sys to view the status of all global and local
coordinate systems.
The local coordinate systems can be Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical,
similar in form to the three predefined global systems. The analyst may define
local cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems in either circular or elliptical
configuration. Additionally, a toroidal  local coordinate system can be defined, as
illustrated in Fig. 3.5.

9

Fig.  3.5 Types of Coordinate System

3.3.1.3 Active Coordinate System
The analyst may define as many coordinate systems as s/he likes, but
only one of these systems may be active at a time. The choice of active
coordinate system is determined as follows: Initially, the global Cartesian system
is active by default. Each time a local coordinate system is defined, that newly-
defined system then automatically becomes the active one. Use one of the
following methods to activate one of the global coordinate systems or some
other previously defined coordinate system:
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Global Cartesian 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Global Cylindrical 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Global Spherical 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Specified Coord Sys 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Working Plane
A coordinate system can be activated in any stage of the ANSYS session.
That same coordinate system will remain active in all later stages until it is
changed intentionally.

10
3.3.2 Display Coordinate System
By default, a listing of nodes or keypoints always shows their global
Cartesian coordinates, even if they were defined in a different coordinate system.
The display coordinate system used in such listings can be changed by one of
the following methods:
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Display CS to&gt; Global Cartesian 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Display CS to&gt; Global Cylindrical
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Display CS to&gt; Global Spherical 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Display CS to&gt; Specified Coord Sys
Changing the display coordinate system will also affect the graphical
displays. Unless a specific effect is advantageous in the displays, reset the
display coordinate system to the global Cartesian system before issuing any
graphics display action commands.
3.3.3 Element Coordinate Systems
Every element has its own coordinate system, the element coordinate
system, that determines the direction of orthotropic material properties, applied
pressures, and results for that element. All element coordinate systems are right-
handed orthogonal systems.
The default orientations for most elements&#39; coordinate systems fit the
following patterns:
 Line elements usually have the element X-axis directed from their node I
toward their node J.
 Shell elements usually have the element X-axis similarly directed (from I
toward J), the Z-axis normal to the shell surface, and the Y-axis
perpendicular to the X and Z axes.
 For 2-D and 3-D solid elements, the element coordinate system is usually
parallel to the global Cartesian system.
Many element types have key options that permit to change the default
element coordinate system orientation. For area and volume elements, the
analyst can also change the orientation to align the element coordinate system
with a previously defined local system by using: Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
Meshing&gt; Mesh Attributes&gt; Default Attribs or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Elements&gt; Elem Attributes.

11
3.3.4  Results Coordinate System
Results data are calculated during solution and consist of displacements
(UX, UY, ROTX, etc.), gradients (TGX, TGY, etc.), stresses (SX, SY, SZ, etc.),
strains (EPPLX, EPPLXY, etc.), etc. These data are stored in the database and on
the results file in either the nodal coordinate system or the element coordinate
system. However, results data are generally rotated into the active results
coordinate system for displays, listings, and element table data storage.
The active results coordinate system can be changed to another system,
or to the coordinate systems used during solution. On listing, displaying, or
operating on the results data, they are rotated to this results coordinate system
first. Use Main Menu&gt; General Postproc&gt; Options for Output or Utility Menu&gt;
List&gt; Results&gt; Options to change the results coordinate system.
3.4 Working Planes
Although the cursor appears as a point on the screen, it actually
represents a line through space, normal to the screen. In order to be able to pick
a point with the cursor, it is necessary to define an imaginary plane that, when
intersected by the normal line of the cursor, will yield a unique point in space.
This imaginary plane is called a working plane (Fig. 3.6). Another way to consider
the interaction between the cursor and the working plane is to picture the cursor
as a point that moves around on the working plane. The working plane, then,
acts as a ‘tablet’ on which the analyst writes with the cursor.

Fig. 3.6 Relationships among Display Screen, Cursor, Working Plane, and Picked Point
A working plane is an infinite plane with an origin, a 2-D coordinate
system, a snap increment, and a display grid. Only one working plane can be
defined at a time. Creating a new working plane eliminates the existing working
plane. The working plane is separate from the coordinate systems; for example,

12

the working plane can have a different point of origin and rotation than the
active coordinate system.
3.4.1 Creating a Working Plane
By default, when the analyst initiates the ANSYS session, there is a
working plane located on the global Cartesian X-Y plane, with its x and y axes
colinear with the global Cartesian X and Y axes.
3.4.1.1 Defining a New Working Plane
A new working plane (Fig. 3.7) can be defined by using any of the
following methods:
 Use  Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Align WP with&gt; XYZ Locations to
define a working plane by three points, or by locating it on the plane
normal to a viewing vector at a specified point.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Align WP with&gt; Nodes to define a
working plane by three nodes, or by locating it on the plane normal to a
viewing vector at a specified node.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Align WP with&gt; Keypoints to define a
working plane by three keypoints, or by locating it on the plane normal to
a viewing vector at a specified keypoint.
3.4.1.2 Controlling the Display and Style of the Working Plane
Use Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Status&gt; Working Plane to obtain the current
status of the working plane.
3.4.1.3 Moving the Working Plane
A working plane can be moved to a new location using any of the
following methods:
 Use Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Offset WP to&gt; Keypoints to move the
working plane origin to the average location of keypoints.
 Use  Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Offset WP to&gt; Nodes to move the
working plane origin to the average location of nodes.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Offset WP by Increments to offset the
working plane.

3.4.1.4 Rotating the Working Plane

13

The working plane can be rotated to a new orientation in two ways: by
rotating the working plane&#39;s x-y coordinate system within the plane, or by
rotating the entire plane to a new position. Use Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt;
Offset WP by Increments to rotate the working plane.
3.4.2 Working Plane Enhancements
The working plane can be enhanced with a snap increment, a display
grid, retrieval tolerance, and coordinate type using GUI path described earlier.
Then, the coordinate system can be forced to follow the working plane as the
working plane is moved using:
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Global Cartesian 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Global Cylindrical 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Global Spherical 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Specified Coordinate Sys 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Change Active CS to&gt; Working Plane 
 Utility Menu&gt; WorkPlane&gt; Offset WP to&gt; Global Origin.
All geometry is created with respect to the working plane, which by default is
aligned with the global Cartesian coordinate system. The ‘Working Plane’ is actually the
XY plane of the working coordinate system. The working coordinate system ID is
coordinate system 4 in ANSYS. Global Cartesian is ID 0, Global Cylindrical is ID 1, and
Global Spherical is ID 2.
Turn on the working plane using Utility Menu&gt; Work Plane&gt; Display Working
Plane. Change the way the working plane looks or adjust the snap settings under Utility
Menu&gt; Work Plane&gt; WP Settings…. Move the working plane around using Utility
Menu&gt; Work Plane&gt; Offset WP to…. Align the working plane with various parts of the
model using Utility Menu&gt; Work Plane&gt; Align WP with…. If more than one node or
keypoint is selected to offset the working plane to, it will go to the average location of the
selected entities. The working plane can be used to slice and dice the model. For
example to cut an area in pieces use Main Menu&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Divide&gt; Area by WrkPlane.

Fig. 3.7 Working Plane

3.5 Solid Modeling

14

A solid model relieves the analyst of the time-consuming task of building a
complicated finite element model by direct generation. Some solid modeling and
meshing operations can help to speed up the creation of the final analysis model.
3.5.1 Solid Modeling Operations
The points that define the vertices of the model are called keypoints and
are the ‘lowest-order’ solid model entities. If, in building the solid model, the
analyst first creates the keypoints, and then uses those keypoints to define the
‘higher-order’ solid model entities, the model is said to be built ‘from the bottom
up’ (Fig. 3.8). Models built from the bottom up are defined within the currently
active coordinate system.

Fig. 3.8  Bottom Up Construction

The ANSYS program also gives the analyst the ability to assemble the
model using geometric primitives, which are fully-defined lines, areas, and
volumes. As a primitive is created, the program automatically creates all the
‘lower’ entities associated with it. If the modeling effort begins with the ‘higher’
primitive entities, the model is said to be built ‘from the top down.’ Bottom up
and top down modeling techniques can be freely combined, as appropriate, in
any model. Remember that geometric primitives (Fig. 3.9) are built within the
working plane while bottom up techniques are defined against the active
coordinate system.

Fig. 3.9  Top Down Constructions (Primitives)

15

Using Boolean operators: The analyst can ‘sculpt’ the solid model using
intersections, subtractions, and other Boolean operations (Fig. 3.10). Booleans
allow to work directly with higher solid model entities to create complex shapes.
Both bottom up and top down creations can be used in Boolean operations.

Fig. 3.10  Create Complex Shapes With Boolean Operations

Dragging and rotating: Boolean operators, although convenient, can be
computationally costly. Sometimes a model can be constructed more efficiently
by dragging (Fig. 3.11) or rotating.

Fig. 3.11  Dragging an Area to Create a Volume

Moving and copying solid model entities: A complicated area or volume
that appears repetitively in the model need only be constructed once; it can then
be moved, rotated, and copied (Fig. 3.12) to a new location on the model. It

16

might be more convenient to place geometric primitives in their proper location
by moving them, rather than by changing the working plane.

Fig. 3.12  Copying an Area

Meshing: The ultimate objective in building a solid model is to mesh (Fig. 3.13)
that model with nodes and elements. First complete the solid model, set element
attributes, and establish meshing controls. Then turn the ANSYS program free to
generate the finite element mesh. A ‘mapped’ mesh containing all quadrilateral,
all triangular, or all brick elements can be requested by taking care to meet
certain requirements.

Fig. 3.13  Free and Mapped Meshes

Moving and copying nodes and elements: Automatic meshing is a vast
improvement over direct generation of nodes and elements, but it can
sometimes be computationally time consuming. If the model contains repetitive
features, the most efficient approach to model generation would be to model and
mesh a pattern region of the model and then generate copies (Fig. 3.14) of that
meshed region.

17

Fig. 3.14  Copying a Meshed Area

Solid model loads: In the ANSYS program, loads are normally associated with
nodes and elements. However, using solid modeling, it is inconvenient to define
loads at nodes and elements. Fortunately, loads may be assigned directly to the
solid model. When the solution calculations are initiated, the program will
automatically transfer these solid model loads to the finite element model.
Revising the model (clearing and deleting): Before revising the model, it is
necessary to be aware of the hierarchy of solid model and finite element model
entities. A lower order entity cannot be deleted if it is attached to a higher-order
entity. Thus, a volume cannot be deleted if it has been meshed, a line cannot be
deleted if it is attached to an area, and so forth. If an entity is attached to any
loads, deleting or redefining that entity will delete the attached loads from the
database. The hierarchy of modeling entities is as listed below:
Highest Elements (and Element Loads)
Nodes (and Nodal Loads)

  Volumes (and Solid-Model Body Loads)
  Areas (and Solid-Model Surface Loads)
  Lines (and Solid-Model Line Loads)
Lowest Keypoints (and Solid-Model Point Loads)
If it is necessary to revise (Fig. 3.15) a solid model after it has been
meshed, first delete all the nodes and elements in the portion of the model to be
revised, using Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Clear. Solid model entities
can be deleted and redefined after clearing the solid model. As an alternative to
clearing, deleting, and redefining, consider modifying the keypoints directly,
using:  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Keypoints&gt; Set
of KPs  or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Keypoints&gt;
Single KP.

18

3.5.2 Creating the Solid Model from the Bottom Up
Any solid model, whether assembled from the bottom up or from the top
down, is defined in terms of keypoints, lines, areas, and
volumes. Figure 3.16 illustrates these entities.

Fig. 3.16  Basic Solid Model Entities

19

Geometry in ANSYS is created from Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
Modeling&gt; Create and has the following terminology (Fig. 3.17),
Keypoints: These are points, locations in 3D space.
Lines: This includes straight lines, curves, circles, spline curves, etc. Lines are
typically defined using existing keypoints.
Areas: This is a surface. When an area is created, it’s associated lines and
keypoints are automatically created to border it.
Volumes: This is a solid. When a volume is created, it’s associated areas, lines
and keypoints are automatically created.
Solid model: In most packages this would refer to the volumes only, but in
ANSYS this refers to the geometry. Any geometry, for example, a line is
considered a ‘solid model’. A child entity cannot be deleted without deleting its
parent, in other words a line cannot be deleted if it’s a part of an area, can’t
delete a keypoint if it’s the end point of a line, etc.
Keypoints are the vertices, lines are the edges, areas are the faces, and
volumes are the interior of the object. Notice that there is a hierarchy in these
entities: volumes, the highest-order entities, are bounded by areas, which are
bounded by lines, which in turn are bounded by keypoints.
In bottom up construction, first create keypoints and use those keypoints
to define higher-order solid model entities (Fig. 3.17).

Fig. 3.17 Bottom up construction

3.5.2.1 Keypoints
When building the model from the bottom up, begin by defining the
lowest-order solid model entities, keypoints. Keypoints are defined within the
currently active coordinate system. Then define lines, areas, and volumes
connecting these keypoints. It is not always necessary to explicitly define all
entities in ascending order to create higher-order entities: define areas and
volumes directly in terms of the keypoints at their vertices. The intermediate
entities will then be generated automatically as needed. For example, a brick-like
volume is defined in terms of the eight keypoints at its corners, the program will
automatically generate the bounding areas and lines.

Volumes Areas Keypoints

Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Keypoints&gt; In
Active CS or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Keypoints&gt; On
Working Plane to define individual keypoints in the active coordinate system.
Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Keypoints&gt; On Line or
Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Keypoints&gt; On Line w/Ratio
to define individual keypoints at a given location on an existing line.
Once an initial pattern of keypoints is created, generate additional
keypoints and work with existing keypoints using:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling &gt; Create&gt; Keypoints&gt; KP between
KPs to create a keypoint between two existing keypoints
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling &gt; Create&gt; Keypoints&gt; Fill between
KPs to generate keypoints between two keypoints.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling &gt; Create&gt; Keypoints&gt; KP at
Center to create a keypoint at the center of a circular arc defined by three
locations.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Copy&gt; Keypoints to generate
additional keypoints from a pattern of keypoints.
The keypoints can be maintained using the methods listed below:
 Use Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Keypoint&gt; Coordinates +Attributes or Utility
Menu&gt; List&gt; Keypoint&gt; Coordinates +Attributes or Utility Menu&gt; List&gt;
Keypoint&gt; Coordinates only or Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Keypoint&gt; Hard
Points or Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Keypoint&gt; Coordinates +Attributes or
Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Keypoint&gt; Coordinates only or Utility Menu&gt; List&gt;
Keypoint&gt; Hard Points or Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Keypoint&gt; Coordinates
only or Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Keypoint&gt; Hard Points to list defined
keypoints.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; Select&gt; Entities to select keypoints.
3.5.2.2 Lines
Lines are mainly used to represent the edges of an object. As with
keypoints, lines are defined within the currently active coordinate system. It is
not always necessary to define all lines explicitly, because the program will
generate the necessary lines in many instances when an area or volume is
defined. Lines are required if it is necessary to generate line elements or to
create areas from lines.
Copy a pattern of lines to generate additional lines using any of the
methods described below:

21

Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Copy&gt; Lines or Main
Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Lines to generate additional
lines from a pattern of lines. Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt;
Reflect&gt; Lines to generate lines from a line pattern by symmetry reflection.
An existing line can be modified by redefining it by using one of the
methods described below:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Divide&gt; Line into 2 Ln&#39;s or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt;
Operate&gt; Booleans&gt; Divide&gt; Line into N Ln&#39;s or Main Menu&gt;

Operate&gt; Booleans&gt; Divide&gt; Lines w/Options or Main Menu&gt;
Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt; Divide&gt; Lines w/
Options to divide up a line into smaller lines.
Lines can be maintained using the methods listed below:
 Use Utility Menu&gt; Plot&gt; Lines or Utility Menu&gt; Plot&gt; Specified
Entities&gt; Lines to display lines.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Line and Below or
Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Lines Only to delete
lines

3.5.2.3 Areas
Flat areas are used to represent 2-D solid objects. Curved as well as flat
areas are used to represent 3-D surfaces, such as shells, and the faces of 3-D
solid objects. Areas are required to use area elements or to create volumes from
areas. Most commands that create areas will also automatically generate the
necessary lines and keypoints; similarly, many areas can be conveniently
generated by defining volumes.
Any of the methods described below can be used to explicitly define
areas. Several geometric primitives and Boolean commands can also be used to
generate or modify areas.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Areas&gt; Arbitrary&gt;
Through KPs to define an area in terms of its vertices.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Areas&gt; Arbitrary&gt;
By Lines to define an area in terms of its boundaries.

22

 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Extrude&gt; Along
Lines to define an area by ‘sweeping’ a line along a characteristic path.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt;Extrude&gt; About
Axis to define an area by rotating a line pattern about an axis.
Existing areas can be copied to generate additional areas using the
methods described below:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Copy&gt; Areas or Main Menu&gt;
Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Areas&gt; Areas to generate
additional areas from a pattern of areas.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Reflect&gt; Areas to generate
areas form an area pattern by symmetry reflection.
Use the methods listed below to maintain areas. Only unmeshed areas
that are not attached to a volume can be redefined or deleted.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Areas or Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Picked Entities&gt;
Areas to list defined areas.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; Plot&gt; Areas or v Utility Menu&gt; Plot&gt; Areas or Utility
Menu&gt; Plot&gt; Specified Entities&gt; Areas or Utility Menu&gt; Plot&gt;
Specified Entities&gt; Areas to display areas.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Area and Below or
Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Areas Only to delete
areas.

3.5.2.4 Volumes
Volumes are used to represent 3-D objects, and are required only to use
volume elements. Most commands that create volumes will also automatically
generate the necessary lower-order entities.
Adopt any of the methods described below to define volumes. Several
geometric primitives and Boolean commands can also be used to generate or
modify areas.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Volumes&gt;
Arbitrary&gt; Through KPs to define a volume in terms of its vertices.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Volumes&gt;
Arbitrary&gt; By Areas to define a volume in terms of its boundaries.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Extrude&gt; About
Axis to define a volume by rotating an area pattern about an axis.

23

Volumes can be maintained using the methods described below. Note that
only unmeshed volumes can be redefined or deleted.
 Use: Utility Menu&gt; List&gt; Picked Entities&gt; Volumes or Utility Menu&gt;
List&gt; Volumes to list volumes.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; Plot&gt; Specified Entities&gt; Volumes or Utility Menu&gt;
Plot&gt; Volumes to display volumes.
 Use Utility Menu&gt; Select&gt; Entities to select volumes.

3.5.3 Creating the Solid Model from the Top Down
In top down construction, geometric primitives are used to assemble the
model. As a primitive is created, the program automatically creates all the ‘lower’
entities associated with it. A geometric primitive is a commonly used solid
modeling shape that can be created with a single ANSYS command.
Because primitives are higher-order entities that can be
constructed without  first defining any keypoints, model generation that uses
primitives is sometimes referred to as ‘top down’ modeling. Geometric primitives
are created within the working plane.
Bottom up and top down modeling techniques can freely be combined, as
appropriate, in any model. Remember that geometric primitives are built within
the working plane while bottom up techniques are defined against the active
coordinate system.
3.5.3.1 Creating Area Primitives
Any area primitives created will lie flat on the working plane and will be
oriented according to the working plane coordinate system. Area primitives must
have surface areas greater than zero.
3.5.3.2 Creating Volume Primitives
Volume primitives are positioned relative to the working plane.
3.5.4 Sculpting the Model with Boolean Operations
Boolean operations can be applied to almost any solid model construction,
whether it was created from the top down or from the bottom up. The only
exceptions are that Boolean operations are not valid for entities created by

24

concatenation and that some Boolean operations cannot always be performed
on entities that contain degeneracies.
Also, all solid-model loads and element attributes should be
defined after the Boolean operations are completed. Take care to redefine the
element attributes and solid-model loads when using Booleans to modify an
existing model.
3.5.4.1 Intersect
An intersection  defines a new set of entities which is common to every
original entity included in the operation (Fig. 3.18). In other words, an
intersection represents the region of overlap of two or more entities. The new
set can be of the same or lower dimension as the original entities. For instance,
the intersection of two lines can be a keypoint, or it can be a line. The Boolean
intersect commands are as follows:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Intersect&gt; Common&gt; Lines to create the intersection of lines.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Intersect&gt; Common&gt; Areas to create the intersection of areas.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Intersect&gt; Common&gt; Volumes to create the intersection of volumes.

Fig. 3.18 Intersect operation

3.5.4.2 Add
An addition  of entities defines a new entity that includes all parts of the
originals (Fig. 3.19). The resulting entity is a single seamless whole, containing
no internal divisions. Only volumes or coplanar 2-D areas can be added in the
ANSYS program. Areas added may contain holes within the area; that is, internal
loops. The Boolean add commands are as follows:

25

 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt; Add&gt;
Areas to add separate areas to create a single area.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt; Add&gt;
Volumes to add separate volumes to create a single volume.

Fig. 3.19 Add operation

3.5.4.3 Subtract
Subtracting (Fig. 3.20) one entity (E2) from another (E1), gives one of
two results: Either the analyst creates a new entity or entities (E1 - E2 ≥ E3) that
is of the same dimensionality as E1 and that contains no overlap with E2, or, if
the overlap is of a lower dimensionality, simply E1 will be divided into two or
more new entities (E1 - E2 ≥ E3 and E4). The Boolean subtract GUI paths are as
follows:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Subtract&gt; Lines or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt;
Booleans&gt; Subtract&gt; With Options&gt; Lines to subtract lines from lines
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Subtract&gt; Areas or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt;
Booleans&gt; Subtract&gt; With Options&gt; Areas to subtract areas from areas.

Fig. 3.20 Subtract operation

3.5.4.4 Overlap
The overlap commands will join two or more entities to create three or
more new entities that encompass all parts of the originals (Fig. 3.21). The end
result is similar to an ‘add’ operation, except that boundaries will be created

26

around the overlap zone. Thus, the overlap operation produces a number of
relatively uncomplicated regions, as compared to the single relatively
complicated region created by the add operation. For this reason, overlapped
entities will often mesh better than added entities.
Overlapping is valid only if the overlap region has the same dimensionality
as the original entities. The Boolean overlap GUI paths are as follows:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Overlap&gt; Lines to overlap lines
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Overlap&gt; Areas to overlap areas.

Fig. 3.21 Overlap operation

3.5.4.5 Partition
The partition commands will join two or more entities to create three or
more new entities that encompass all parts of the originals (Fig. 3.22). The end
result is similar to an ‘overlap’ operation if the overlap is of the same
dimensionality as the original entities. However, unlike the overlap operations,
non-overlapping input entities will not be deleted. The Boolean partition GUI
paths are as follows:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Partition&gt; Lines to partition lines.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Partition&gt; Areas to partition areas.

27

Fig. 3.22 Partition operation

3.5.4.6 Glue (or Merge)
Glue is similar to overlap, except that it applies only to cases in which the
intersection between entities occurs at a boundary, and is one dimension lower
than the original entities (Fig. 3.23). The entities maintain their individuality, but
they become connected at their intersection, as shown in the illustrations below.
The Boolean glue GUI paths are as follows:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Glue&gt; Lines to glue lines by ‘gluing’ lines.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Glue&gt; Areas to glue areas by ‘gluing’ areas.

Fig. 3.23 Glue operation

3.5.4.7 Divide
Divides an entity into two or more entities (Fig. 3.24).

28

Fig. 3.24 Divide operation

3.5.5 Updating after Boolean Operations
Some Boolean commands will automatically update entities after the
Boolean operation is performed on attached lower-order entities. For instance, if
the GUI path Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Add&gt; Areas is used to add several areas together that are attached to a single
volume, that volume will be updated by replacing the original areas with the
newly produced area. This releases the analyst from the work of deleting the
higher-order entity and rebuilding it with bottom up techniques.
3.5.6 Moving and Copying Solid Model Entities
If the model repetitively uses a relatively complicated area or volume, it is
necessary to construct that part only once. Then copies of that part can be
generated in new locations and new orientations as needed.
Move translates or rotates an entity by specifying DX,DY,DZ offsets (Fig.
3.25). DX,DY,DZ are interpreted in the active CS. To translate an entity, make
the active CS Cartesian. To rotate an entity, make the active CS cylindrical or
spherical. Another option is to transfer coordinates to a different system.

29

Fig. 3.25  Moving an area

Geometric primitives can also be considered to be ‘parts’. As geometric
primitives are created, their location and orientation will be determined by the
current working plane. Because it is not always particularly convenient to
redefine the working plane for each new primitive that is created, it is more
practical to allow a primitive to be created at the ‘wrong’ location, and
then move that primitive to its correct position. Of course, this operation is not
limited to geometric primitives: any solid model entity can be copied or moved.
Copy generates multiple copies of an entity. Specify the number of copies
(2 or greater) and the DX,DY,DZ offset for each copy. DX,DY,DZ are interpreted
in the active CS. It is useful to create multiple holes, ribs, protrusions, etc. (Fig.
3.26).

Fig. 3.26 Copying an Area
3.5.6.1 Generating Entities from a Pattern
ANSYS provides the following  GUI paths for generating entities from a
pattern:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Copy&gt; Keypoints to
generate additional keypoints from a pattern of keypoints
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Copy&gt; Lines or
Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Lines to
generate additional lines from a pattern of lines.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Copy&gt; Areas or Main
Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Areas&gt; Areas to
generate additional areas from a pattern of areas.

30

 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Copy&gt; Volumes or Main
Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Volumes to generate
additional volumes from a pattern of volumes.
3.5.6.2 Generating Entities by Symmetry Reflection
ANSYS provides the following  GUI paths for generating entities by
symmetry reflection:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Reflect&gt; Keypoints to
generate a reflected set of keypoints.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Reflect&gt; Lines to generate
lines from a line pattern by symmetry reflection
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Reflect&gt; Areas to generate
areas from an area pattern by symmetry reflection
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Reflect&gt; Volumes to
generate volumes from a volume pattern by symmetry reflection
3.5.6.3 Transferring a Pattern of Entities to a Coordinate System
ANSYS provides the following  GUI paths:
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Transfer
Coord&gt; Keypoints to transfer a pattern of keypoints to another
coordinate system.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Transfer
Coord&gt; Lines to transfer a pattern of lines to another coordinate system.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Transfer
Coord&gt; Areas to transfer a pattern of areas to another coordinate system.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt; Transfer
Coord&gt; Volumes to transfer a pattern of volumes to another coordinate
system.
3.5.7 Other Operations
Besides Booleans, many other operations are available like Extrude, Scale,
Reflect, Merge, Fillet.
3.5.7.1 Extrude
Extrude quickly creates volumes from existing areas (or areas from lines,
and lines from keypoints). If the area is meshed, the elements can be extruded
along with the areas. There are four ways to extrude areas:

31

–Along normal — creates volume by normal offset of areas (Fig. 3.27b)
–By XYZ offset — creates volume by a general x-y-z offset. Allows tapered
extrusion.
–About axis — creates volume by revolving areas about an axis (specified
by two keypoints).
–Along lines — creates volume by ‘dragging’ areas along a line or a set of
contiguous lines.

Fig. 3.27 Extrude operation

3.5.7.2 Reflect
Reflect facilitates reflecting entities about a plane (Fig. 3.28). Specify the
direction of reflection:
–X for reflection about the YZ plane
–Y for XZ plane
–Z for XY plane
All directions are interpreted in the active CS, which must be a Cartesian
system.

32
Fig. 3.28 Reflect Operation

3.5.7.3 Merge
Merge attaches two entities together by removing coincident keypoints
(Fig. 3.29). Observe the removal of coincident keypoints on the centre line.
Merging keypoints will automatically merge coincident higher-order entities, if
any. This is usually required after a reflect, copy, or other operation that causes
coincident entities.

Fig. 3.29 Merge operation

3.5.7.4 Fillet
Line fillet requires two intersecting lines with a common keypoint at the
intersection (Fig. 3.30). If the common keypoint does not exist, do a partition operation
first. ANSYS does not update the underlying area (if any), so either add or subtract the
fillet region. Area filleting is similar.

33
Fig. 3.30 Fillet operation

3.6 Importing Solid Models
A solid model can be created in a favorite CAD system, saved as an IGES
file, and then imported to ANSYS. Once successfully imported, the model can be
meshed similar to any model created within the program.
The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) is a vendor-neutral
standard format used to exchange geometric models between various CAD and
CAE systems. The filter permits import of partial files. Multiple files also can be
imported into the same model.
ANSYS provides the SMOOTH method  for importing IGES files. This
method uses the standard ANSYS geometry database and has no capabilities for
automatically creating volumes.

3.7 Generating the Mesh
The process for generating a mesh of nodes and elements consists of
three general steps:
 Setting the element attributes
 Setting mesh controls
 Meshing the model.
It is not always necessary to set mesh controls because the default mesh
controls are appropriate for many models. If no controls are specified, the
program will use the default settings to produce a free mesh. Alternatively,
the SmartSize feature can be used to produce a better quality free mesh.
3.7.1 Free or Mapped Mesh
Before meshing the model, and even before building the model, it is
important to think about whether a free mesh or a mapped mesh (Fig. 3.31) is
appropriate for the analysis. A free mesh has no restrictions in terms of element
shapes, and has no specified pattern applied to it. A mapped mesh is restricted
in terms of the element shape it contains and the pattern of the mesh. A mapped

34

area mesh contains either only quadrilateral or only triangular elements, while a
mapped volume mesh contains only hexahedron elements. In addition, a
mapped mesh typically has a regular pattern, with obvious rows of elements. To
generate this type of mesh, build the geometry as a series of fairly regular
volumes and/or areas that can accept a mapped mesh.
A mapped mesh generates a very regular grid of elements. This can only
be used on rectangular shaped areas or volumes. A free mesh will mesh any
entity - regardless of shape.

Fig. 3.31 Free and Mapped Meshes

3.7.2 Setting Element Attributes
Before generating a mesh of nodes and elements, the analyst must first
define the appropriate element attributes. That is, s/he must specify the
following:
 The element type
 Real constant set
 Material properties set
 Element coordinate system
 Section ID.
3.7.2.1 Creating Tables of Element Attributes
In order to assign attributes to the elements, the analyst must first build
tables of element attributes. Typical models include element types (menu
path Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Element Type&gt; Add/Edit/Delete), real
constants (menu path Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Real Constants), and
material properties (menu path Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Material
Props&gt; material option).
A table of coordinate systems can also be assembled using Utility Menu&gt;
WorkPlane&gt; Local Coordinate Systems&gt; Create Local CS&gt; option). This table
can be used to assign element coordinate systems to elements.

35

3.7.2.2 Assigning Element Attributes Before Meshing
Once the attribute tables are assembled, the analyst can assign element
attributes to different parts of the model by ‘pointing’ to the appropriate entries
in the tables. The pointers are simply a set of reference numbers that include a
material number (MAT), a real constant set number (REAL), an element type
number (TYPE), a coordinate system number (ESYS) and, for beam meshing
with BEAM188, or BEAM189, a section ID number (SECNUM). The analyst can
either assign the attributes directly to selected solid model entities, or define a
default set of attributes that will be used for elements created in subsequent
meshing operations.
3.7.3 Mesh Controls
The default mesh controls that the program uses may produce a mesh
that is adequate for the model being analyzed. In this case, it is not necessary to
specify any mesh controls. However, if mesh controls are used, set them before
meshing the solid model.
Mesh controls allow establishing such factors as the element shape, mid-
side node placement, and element size to be used in meshing the solid model.
This step is one of the most important of the entire analysis, for the decisions
made at this stage in the model development will profoundly affect the accuracy
and economy of the analysis.
3.7.3.1 The MeshTool
The MeshTool (Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; MeshTool)
provides a convenient path to many of the most common mesh controls, as well
as to the most frequently performed meshing operations. The MeshTool (Fig.
3.32) is an interactive ‘tool box,’ not only because of the numerous functions that
it contains, but also because once opened, it remains open until the analyst
either closes it or exits PREP7.
Although all of the functions available via the MeshTool are also available
via the traditional commands and menus, using the MeshTool is a valuable
shortcut.

36
Fig. 3.32 Mesh Tool

How fine of a mesh should be? Part of this is common sense. Put a finer
mesh in areas of higher stress gradient, like near a stress concentration. Do
simple experiments along with hand calculations; for example about 30 nodes
are needed around a hole to get a good value of the peak stress. The stress
convergence should follow a pattern as shown in Fig. 3.33. When the result is
not changing much for a finer mesh, the mesh is converged.

37

Fig. 3.33 Stress convergence with mesh fineness

If global attributes are set, that material, element type, real constant,
beam section, etc. will be used for all elements in the model. It’s better to use
the drop down to assign different attributes to different geometric entities in the
model. Then mesh the whole model at one time.
Smart Size is used to automatically pick the element edge length
depending on the sizes of features in the geometry. It makes a finer mesh
around smaller features in order to capture them adequately.
3.7.3.2 Element Shape
The analyst should set the allowable element shapes if s/he plans on
meshing with an element type that can take on more than one shape. For
instance, many area elements can both be triangular and quadrilateral shaped
within the same meshed area. Volume elements can often be either hexahedral
or tetrahedral shaped, but a mixture of the two shapes in the same model is not
recommended.
3.7.3.3 Choosing Free or Mapped Meshing
In addition to specifying element shape, the analyst may also want to
specify the type of meshing that should be used to mesh the model. This is done
by setting the meshing key: Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt;
MeshTool or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Mesher Opts.
Use the MeshTool (Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; MeshTool) to
specify meshing type. The MeshTool is the recommended method. Together, the
settings for element shape and meshing type affect the resulting mesh. 
3.7.3.4 Controlling Placement of Midside Nodes

38

When meshing with quadratic elements, the placement of midside nodes
can be controlled. The choices for mid-side node placement are:
 Mid-side nodes of elements on a region boundary follow the curvature of
the boundary line or area. This is the default.
 Place mid-side nodes of all elements so that element edges are straight.
This option allows a coarse mesh along curves. However, the curvature of
the model is not matched.
 Do not create mid-side nodes.
To control mid-side node placement, use: Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
Meshing&gt; Mesher Opts
3.7.3.5 Smart Element Sizing for Free Meshing
Smart element sizing (SmartSizing) is a meshing feature that creates
initial element sizes for free meshing operations. SmartSizing gives the mesher a
better chance of creating reasonably shaped elements during automatic mesh
generation. This feature provides a range of settings for meshing.
By default, the default element size method of element sizing will be used
during free meshing. However, it is recommended that SmartSizing be used
instead for free meshing. To turn SmartSizing on, simply specify an element size
level on the SmartSizing  command.
The Advantages of SmartSizing
The SmartSizing algorithm first computes estimated element edge lengths
for all lines in the areas or volumes being meshed. The edge lengths on these
lines are then refined for curvature and proximity of features in the geometry.
Since all lines and areas are sized before meshing begins, the quality of the
generated mesh is not dependent on the order in which the areas or volumes are
meshed.
If quadrilateral elements are being used for area meshing, SmartSizing
tries to set an even number of line divisions around each area so that an all-
quadrilateral mesh is possible. Triangles will be included in the mesh only if
forcing all quadrilaterals would create poorly shaped elements, or if odd divisions
exist on boundaries.
3.7.3.6 Default Element Sizes for Mapped Meshing
The default element size command allows the analyst to modify such
defaults as: the minimum and maximum number of elements that will be

39

attached to an unmeshed line, maximum spanned angle per element, and
minimum and maximum edge length. This command (Main Menu&gt;
Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt; Global&gt; Other) is always used to control
element sizing for mapped meshing. The settings are also used by default for
free meshing. However, it is recommended to use SmartSizing instead for free
meshing operations.
As an example, the mapped mesh on the left in Fig. 3.34 was produced
with the element size defaults that exist when entering the program. The mesh
on the right was produced by modifying the minimum number of elements
(MINL) and the maximum spanned angle per element (ANGL).

Fig. 3.34  Changing Default Element Sizes

3.7.3.7 Local Mesh Controls
In many cases, the mesh produced by default element sizes is not
appropriate due to the physics of the structure. Examples include models with
stress concentrations or singularities. In these cases, the analyst will have to get
more involved with the meshing process. More control can be taken by using the
following element size specifications:
 Use  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt; Global&gt; Size
to control the global element size in terms of the element edge length
used on surface boundaries or the number of element divisions per line.
 Use  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt; Keypoints&gt; All
KPs or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt; Keypoints&gt;
Picked KPs or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt;
Keypoints&gt; Clr Size to control the element sizes near specified keypoints.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt; Lines&gt; All
Lines or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt; Lines&gt;
Picked Lines or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt;
Lines&gt; Clr Size to control the number of elements on specified lines.
3.7.3.8 Interior Mesh Controls

40

The mesh can also be controlled on the interior of an area where there
are no lines to guide the size of the mesh. To do so, use: Main Menu&gt;
Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Size Cntrls&gt; Global&gt; Area Cntrls.
3.7.4 Controls Used for Free and Mapped Meshing
3.7.4.1  Free Meshing
In free meshing operations, no special requirements restrict the solid
model. Any model geometry, even if it is irregular, can be meshed. The
element shapes used will depend on whether areas or volumes are being
meshed. For area meshing, a free mesh can consist of only quadrilateral
elements, only triangular elements, or a mixture of the two. For volume meshing,
a free mesh is usually restricted to tetrahedral elements.
If the chosen element type is strictly triangular or tetrahedral, the
program will use only that shape during meshing. However, if the chosen
element type allows more than one shape (for
example, PLANE183 or SOLID186), the analyst can specify which shape to use
by: Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Mesher Opts.
Also specify that free meshing should be used to mesh the model, using:
Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Mesher Opts.
For area elements that support more than one shape, a mixed shape
mesh will be produced by default. An all triangle mesh can be requested, but is
not recommended if lower-order elements are being used.
In order to achieve a free volume mesh, choose an element type that
allows only a tetrahedral shape, or use an element that supports multiple shapes
and set the shape option to tetrahedral only.
3.7.4.2 Mapped Meshing
The analyst can specify that the program use all quadrilateral area
elements, all triangle area elements, or all hexahedral volume elements to
generate a mapped mesh. Mapped meshing requires that an area or volume be
‘regular’, that is, it must meet certain criteria.
3.7.5 Meshing the Solid Model
Once solid model is built, element attributes are established, and meshing
controls are set, ANSYS is ready to generate the finite element mesh. First,

41

however, it is usually good practice to save the model before initiating mesh
generation:  Utility Menu&gt; File&gt; Save as Jobname.db.
It may also be necessary to turn on the ‘mesh accept/reject’ prompt by
picking Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Mesher Opts. This feature
allows to easily discard an undesirable mesh.
If multiple volumes or areas are being meshed at one time, consider using
the meshing option By Size so the mesh is created in the smallest volume or
area first. This helps ensure that the mesh is adequately dense in smaller
volumes or areas and that the mesh is of a higher quality.
3.7.6 Changing the Mesh
If it is decided that the generated mesh is not appropriate, the mesh can easily
be changed by one of the following methods:
 Remesh with new element size specifications
 Use the accept/reject prompt to discard the mesh, then remesh
 Clear the mesh, redefine mesh controls, and remesh
 Refine the mesh locally
 Improve the mesh.
3.8 Revising the Model
ANSYS offers various methods for revising and refining the model.
3.8.1 Refining a Mesh Locally
There are generally two situations in which it may be necessary to refine a
mesh in a local region:
 A model has been meshed and the analyst would like a finer mesh in
specific regions of the model, or
 The analyst has completed the analysis and, based on the results, would
like a more detailed solution in a region of interest.
For all area meshes and for volume meshes composed of tetrahedra, the
ANSYS program allows to refine the mesh locally around specified nodes,
elements, keypoints, lines, or areas. Meshes composed of volume elements other
than tetrahedra cannot be locally refined.

42

3.8.1.1 Refining a Mesh
Follow these two steps to refine a mesh:
1. Select the entity around which refinement will be done.
2. Specify the level of refinement to be done. The refined elements will
always be smaller than the original elements; the local mesh refinement
process does not provide mesh coarsening (LEVEL).
3.8.1.2 Refinement Commands and Menu Paths
Use the following  menu paths to select entities for refinement and to set
refinement controls.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Modify Mesh&gt; Refine At&gt;
Nodes to refine around a selected set of nodes
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Modify Mesh&gt; Refine
At&gt;Elements or Main Menu &gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Modify Mesh&gt;
Refine At&gt; All to refine around a selected set of elements.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Modify Mesh&gt; Refine At&gt;
Keypoints to refine around a selected set of keypoints.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Modify Mesh&gt; Refine At&gt;
Lines to refine around a selected set of lines
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Modify Mesh&gt; Refine At&gt;
Areas to refine around a selected set of areas.
Figure 3.35 shows examples of mesh refinement around a node, element,
keypoint, and line. Figure 3.36 illustrates the use of the command to perform
tetrahedral mesh refinement around an area.

43

Fig. 3.36  Tetrahedral Mesh Refinement Around an Area

3.8.1.3 Transfer of Attributes and Loads
Element attributes associated with the ‘parent’ element are automatically
transferred to all of the ‘child’ elements. These attributes include element type,
material properties, real constants, and element coordinates.
Loads and boundary conditions applied to the solid model are transferred
to nodes and elements when the solution is initiated. Therefore, solid model
loads will be correctly applied to the new nodes and elements created during
refinement. However, loads and boundary conditions applied at the node and
element level cannot be transferred to new nodes and elements created during
refinement. If there are such loads in a region selected for refinement, the
program will not allow refinement to take place unless the loads are first deleted.
Therefore, it is recommended that loads be applied only to the solid model rather
than directly to nodes and elements if using mesh refinement is anticipated.
3.8.2 Keeping Track of Element Faces and Orientations
If the model contains shell elements, and if surface loads are applied, the
analyst needs to keep track of the element faces in order to be able to define the
proper direction for the loads. In general, shell surface loads will be applied to
element face one, and will be positive in accordance with the right-hand rule
(following the I, J, K, L nodal sequence, as illustrated in Fig. 3.37). If shell
elements are created by meshing a solid model area, the normal direction of the
elements will be consistent with the normal direction of the area. The area&#39;s
normal direction can be determined by executing menu path Utility Menu&gt;
List&gt; Areas; the direction of the sequence of lines defining that area will define
the normal direction by the right-hand rule.

44

Fig. 3.37  Positive Normal Direction as Defined by the Right-Hand Rule
3.8.3 Revising a Meshed Model: Clearing and Deleting
Because of the solid modeling cross-reference checking that the ANSYS
program performs, meshed solid model entities cannot be deleted. In order to
revise the model, the analyst needs to clear solid model entities of their meshes
by using the mesh clearing commands. These clearing commands can be
thought of as the inverse of the meshing commands. After clearing the model,
the analyst can proceed to modify the solid model as desired.
3.8.3.1 Clearing a Mesh
The mesh clearing commands delete the nodes and elements associated
with the corresponding solid model entity. When a higher level entity is cleared,
all lower level entities will be automatically cleared, unless those lower entities
are themselves meshed with elements. Nodes on the boundary of an entity
shared by an adjoining meshed entity are not  deleted as a result of clearing.
 Use  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Clear&gt; Keypoints to delete
nodes and point elements associated with selected keypoints
 Use  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Clear&gt; Lines to delete
nodes and line elements associated with selected lines
 Use  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Clear&gt; Areas to delete
nodes and area elements associated with selected areas
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Meshing&gt; Clear&gt; Volumes to delete
nodes and volume elements associated with selected volumes
The program will report how many of each kind of entity have been
cleared after a mesh clearing operation. An entity is considered to have been
‘cleared’ if either its elements or its nodes have been cleared. If the
elements/nodes being cleared are at the end of the element/node lists, then the
next available element/node ID is reset accordingly.
3.8.3.2  Deleting Solid Model Entities

45

Solid model entities can be deleted with the entity deletion commands
described below. Lower level entities cannot be independently deleted if they are
attached to a higher level entity. Thus, if a block is created using a geometric
primitive command, the analyst cannot selectively delete a keypoint that is
associated with that block, unless he/she first deletes, in descending hierarchical
order, all the higher level entities that are attached to that keypoint.
 Use  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Area and Below or
Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Areas Only to delete
unmeshed areas.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Keypoints to delete
unmeshed keypoints.
 Use  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Line and Below or
Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Lines Only to delete
unmeshed lines.
 Use  Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Volume and
Below or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Delete&gt; Volumes Only
to delete unmeshed volumes.
3.8.3.3 Modifying Solid Model Entities
The geometry of a solid model can be modified by changing the position
of its keypoints using: Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Move/Modify&gt;
Keypoints&gt; Set of KPs or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt;
Move/Modify&gt; Keypoints&gt; Single KP
Any meshed regions attached to modified keypoints will be automatically
cleared of nodes and elements. All lines, areas, and volumes attached to the
modified keypoint will then be automatically redefined using the active
coordinate system.
Unmeshed lines can be modified using the operations described below.
These operations will also update attached unmeshed areas, even if these areas
are attached to volumes.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt;
Divide&gt; Line into 2 Lns or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt;
Operate&gt; Booleans&gt; Divide&gt; Line into N Lns or Main Menu&gt;
Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt; Divide&gt; Lines w/
Options to divide a single line into two or more lines.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Operate&gt; Booleans&gt; Add&gt;
Lines to combine adjacent lines into one line.
 Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Lines&gt; Lines&gt;
Line Fillet to generate a fillet line between two intersecting lines.

46

3.8.4 Understanding Solid Model Cross-Reference Checking
Several conditions restrict the analyst as s/he modifies the meshed solid
model. These restrictions arise due to the cross-reference checking that has been
incorporated into the ANSYS program to prevent contamination of the solid
model and finite element model data. They may be summarized as follows:
 Meshed keypoints, lines, areas, or volumes may not be deleted or moved.
 Nodes or elements associated with keypoints, lines, areas, or volumes
may not be moved. They can be deleted only with the mesh clearing
commands.
 Areas contained in volumes may not be deleted or changed.
 Lines contained in areas may not be deleted or changed.
 Keypoints contained in lines may not be deleted.
The basic reasoning behind these rules might be visualized from Fig. 3.38.
Schematically, the completed model can be thought of as a stack of blocks, in
which the bottommost block represents the keypoints, the next block represents
lines, and so forth. If a lower entity was to be disturbed, the analyst would
disturb the entities that are stacked on top of it. This illustration somewhat
oversimplifies the dependence of higher level entities on lower entities.

Fig. 3.38   Solid Model Cross-Reference Checking

3.9 Direct Generation
Direct generation is the approach in which the nodes and elements of a
model are defined directly. Many convenience commands allow the analyst to
copy, reflect, scale, etc. a given pattern of nodes or elements. However, direct
generation requires about ten times as many data entries to define a model as
compared to solid modeling. Planning, coordinate systems, and working planes
apply to direct generation as well as to solid modeling.

47

A model assembled by direct generation is defined in terms of nodes and
elements. Even though node and element generation operations can be
interspersed, no one element can be defined until after all of its nodes have been
created.
3.9.1 Nodes
This section describes various GUI paths related to the direct generation
of nodes. Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Nodes&gt; In
Active CS or &gt; On Working Plane to define individual nodes in the active
coordinate system. Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt;
Nodes&gt; On Keypoint to define a node at an existing keypoint.
3.9.2 Elements
3.9.2.1 Prerequisites for Defining Element Attributes
Define the minimum number of nodes required for that element and
specify the proper element attributes before directly generating elements.
Assemble tables of element attributes.
Once the element attribute tables are in place, the analyst can ‘point’ to
various entries in the element tables. The values of these pointers, that are in
effect at the time of creating the elements, are used by the program to assign
attributes from the tables to the elements.
3.9.2.2 Defining Elements
After defining the necessary nodes and seting the element attributes, the
analyst can proceed to define the elements. An element can be defined by
identifying its nodes using Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt;
Elements&gt; Auto Numbered&gt; Thru Nodes or Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Elements&gt; User Numbered&gt; Thru Nodes. The number of
nodes required for each element and the order in which they must be input are
determined by the element type. The order in which nodes are defined
determines the element normal direction.
3.9.2.3 Reading and Writing Text Files That Contain Element Data
ANSYS program can read or write a text file that contains element data.
These capabilities can be useful for transferring data to and from another
program. Normally it will not be necessary to use these capabilities in a standard
ANSYS model generating session.

48
3.9.2.4 Overlapping Elements
If overlapping elements are created, various ANSYS features such as
graphics, surface loads, selecting logic, etc. might not function as expected. It is
best to avoid the use of overlapping elements altogether; if this is not possible,
use extreme caution whenever overlapping elements are employed.
3.10 Number Control and Element Reordering
The numbering of keypoints, lines, areas, volumes, elements, nodes,
element types, real constant sets, materials, coupled DOF sets, constraint
equations, and coordinate systems can be controlled as per requirement. Control
of the numbering is also useful when combining separately modeled portions of a
model into one.
3.10.1 Number Control
The GUI paths described here gives the analyst control of the numbering.
Control of the numbering is useful when combining separately modeled portions
of a model into one.
3.10.1.1  Merging Coincident Items
If two separate entities have the same location, these entities can be
merged together into a single entity using Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
Numbering Ctrls&gt; Merge Items.
For example, suppose that there are two separate but coincident nodes. If
the nodes are merged, the higher numbered node will be deleted and will be
replaced with the lower numbered coincident node. Two coincident nodes will
thus be replaced by a single node.
3.10.1.2  Compressing Item Numbers
As the model is built, the analyst creates unused slots in the numbering
sequence for various items by deleting, clearing, merging, or performing other
operations. These slots will remain empty for some items but will be filled in for
other items as new items are created. These gaps can be eliminated by
‘compressing’ the numbering to save data storage space or to preserve desired
sequencing. Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Numbering Ctrls&gt; Compress
Numbers. The compression operation may be selectively re-executed for chosen
item groups or may be simultaneously applied to all valid items.

49
3.10.1.3  Setting Starting Numbers
When creating new, automatically-numbered items, it is suggested to set
the starting number of the new series of items higher than the greatest number
used by existing items. By doing so, it is ensured that the newly created entities
will be consecutively numbered, and will thus be prevented from occupying gaps
in the existing numbering sequence. Also, while creating portions of the model
independently of one another, a set of starting numbers is specified to avoid
numbering conflicts when they are combined together into one model. Such
user-defined starting numbers can be specified using:  Main Menu&gt;
Preprocessor&gt; Numbering Ctrls&gt; Set Start Number.
3.10.1.4 Adding Number Offsets
In order to combine two independently created portions of a model and to
prevent numbering conflicts, all selected items can be renumbered by adding an
offset value to their existing numbers. Use Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
Numbering Ctrls&gt; Add Num Offset. Re-execute this operation for each item
group that is to be renumbered.
3.10.2 Element Reordering
At the start of a solution, the ANSYS program will automatically reorder
the elements so that they can be accessed in close proximity to each other. This
reordering scheme could improve the memory usage and, hence, the speed of
the global assembly. This operation does not affect the element numbers used to
identify elements in pre- and post-processing of the database. In most cases,
allowing the ANSYS program to reorder elements automatically is the preferred
approach. The original element ordering can be reestablished using: Main
Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Numbering Ctrls&gt; Element Reorder&gt; Reset Elem
Order.

Any time the analyst deletes/modifies items like elements, nodes, areas
and tries to create some more, s/he will see that ANSYS doesn&#39;t number
the entities starting from one. The concept of ‘Compressing the numbers’
will be used to tackle this problem. Then ANSYS is forced to start
numbering from the next available number.
Ex: Suppose 1 area is created and for some reason the first one is split
into 4. If the analyst tries to create more areas, most probably next one
will be numbered as 2 NOT 1. This problem will be avoided if the
following concept used.
