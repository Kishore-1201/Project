    <custom-heading level="1">1 ANSYS BASICS</custom-heading><br>

    ANSYS is a sophisticated and comprehensive finite element program. It
    has capabilities in many different physics fields such as static structural,
    nonlinear, thermal, implicit and explicit dynamics, fluid flow, electromagnetics,
    and electric field analysis (Fig. 1.1). Obviously because ANSYS is a huge
    program with so many capabilities it is impossible to cover everything in this
    small book. This book will give an introduction as to how the ANSYS program
    works and how these basic skills will be applicable to any type of analysis
    within ANSYS. The most important concepts in using ANSYS will be addressed
    here in a compressed format. The key to becoming productive in any
    computer aided engineering program is to start to think like the program
    thinks, to get the big picture of how it works in general.<br>

    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.1 Some applications of ANSYS</image-tag><br>
    ANSYS is an integrated program with all operations performed under
    one Graphic User Interface, GUI. Creating the model, running it, and
    postprocessing the results are all done without leaving the ANSYS
    environment.<br>
    <custom-spacing>There are many different ways of working within ANSYS. Like every
    software, ANSYS is driven by commands. It gives easy access to these
    commands. These commands are simple to use; just a keyword followed by
    several arguments.</custom-spacing><br>
    New ANSYS users generally don’t use scripting to start with and just
    want to find out how to do what they want within the GUI environment.
    That’s where this book starts as well. Each key concept is explained as briefly
    as possible.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.1 Finite Element Method</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>It is very helpful to an engineer using ANSYS to have at least some
    idea of how the finite element method (FEM) works. What happens internally
    when ANSYS is told to Solve? Many terms associated with finite element
    modeling in general heard over and over again are based on the common
    numerical algorithms. After all, the finite element method is purely a
    mathematical technique.</custom-spacing><br>

    <custom-spacing>The FEM was developed more by engineers during the 1950s and
    1960s using physical insight than by mathematicians using abstract methods.
    The underlying theory is over 100 years old. It was the basis for pen-and-
    paper calculations in the evaluation of suspension bridges and steam boilers.
    It was first applied to problems of stress analysis. In all applications the
    analyst seeks to calculate a field quantity: in stress analysis it is the
    displacement field or the stress field; in thermal analysis it is the temperature
    field or the heat flux; in fluid flow it is the stream function or the velocity
    potential function; and so on. Results of greatest interest are usually peak
    values of either the field quantity or its gradients. The FE method is a way of
    getting a numerical solution to a specific problem. An FE analysis does not
    produce a formula as a solution, nor does it solve a class of problems. Also,
    the solution is approximate unless the problem is so simple that a convenient
    exact formula is already available.</custom-spacing><br>
    When there is a structure like a simply supported beam, it’s easy
    enough to grab an engineering handbook or textbook and look up the
    equations needed to calculate the bending moments and displacements.
    However if there is a structure that is even just a little more complicated, like
    a stepladder (Fig. 1.2) for example, one will not be able to go to the
    engineering handbook and look up the stepladder equation. Sure, it’s possible
    to derive some governing equation(s) for the stepladder but this might be a
    lot of trouble. For even more complex structures it quickly becomes
    impossible to do so.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="36.png" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.2 A Stepladder and its FE Model</image-tag><br>

    <custom-spacing>This is where the finite element technique comes in. In this method an
    arbitrarily complex structure that cannot be described with an equation is
    broken down into small pieces, each of which is simple enough on it’s own
    that it can be described with an equation. While the actual structure
    theoretically contains an infinite number of small pieces it could be broken
    down into, this method breaks it down into a finite number of pieces of a
    specific size that analyst can choose. The smaller the pieces, the closer the
    approximation is to reality. Then the response of the entire structure is
    calculated by essentially summing up the response of each little piece. These
    small pieces are called <custom-style>elements</custom-style>, and each element is connected to its
    neighbor by nodes at each of its vertices.</custom-spacing><br>
    More and more these days solid part is meshed to create nodes and
    elements. It’s important to realize that the solid CAD part is not the finite
    element model; it is just a vehicle used to tell ANSYS where analyst wants the
    nodes and elements to go. The finite element method works only with the
    nodes and elements.<br>
    <custom-spacing>The FE method involves cutting a structure into several elements
    (pieces of the structure), describing the behavior of each element in a simple
    way, and then connecting elements together again. This process results in a
    set of simultaneous algebraic equations. In stress analysis these equations
    are equilibrium equations of the connection points. There may be several
    hundred or several thousand such equations, which means that computer
    implementation is mandatory. A more sophisticated description of the FE
    method regards it as piecewise polynomial interpolation. That is, over an
    element, a field quantity such as displacement is interpolated from values of
    the field quantity at the connection points. By connecting elements together,
    the field quantity becomes interpolated over the entire structure in piecewise
    fashion, by as many polynomial expressions as there are elements. The best
    values of the field quantity at the connection points are those that minimize
    some function such as total energy. The minimization process generates a set
    of simultaneous algebraic equations for values of the field quantity at the
    connection points.</custom-spacing><br>
    The power of the FE method is its versatility. The object analyzed may
    have arbitrary shape, arbitrary supports and arbitrary loads. Such generality
    does not exist in classical analytical methods. For example, temperature-
    induced stresses are difficult to analyze with classical methods, even when
    the structure geometry and the temperature field are both simple. The FE
    method treats thermal stresses as easily as stresses induced by mechanical
    load, and the temperature distribution itself can be calculated by FE.<br>
    <custom-spacing>The theory of FE includes matrix manipulations, numerical integration,
    equation solving, and other procedures carried out automatically by
    commercial software. The analyst may see only hints of these procedures as
    the software processes data. The analyst deals mainly with preprocessing
    (describing loads, supports, materials, and generating the FE mesh) and
    postprocessing (sorting output, listing and plotting of results).</custom-spacing><br>
    There are various levels of engineering abstraction built into different
    kinds of elements. A solid element is fully defined by its geometry in 3D space
    (think of it as a small block cut out of the part), while shells (also called
    plates) are idealized by a surface and so need a thickness to be assigned for
    them to fully understand what they are. A beam element is a further
    abstraction. A simple line between two points defines it geometrically, and so
    analyst has to supply its area, moment of inertia, torsional stiffness, etc.<br>
    <custom-spacing>All of the basic calculations in the finite element method are performed
    at the nodes. What happens inside an element between the nodes is
    controlled by the element shape function. This is an assumed distribution of
    the primary variable and can be linear, quadratic, cubic, etc. For structural
    analysis the primary variable is the displacement and is also called the degree
    of freedom (DOF). A general three dimensional structural model has six
    degrees of freedom at each node, translations in the X, Y and Z directions,
    and rotations about those three axes. For a thermal analysis the degrees of
    freedom are the temperatures at each node.</custom-spacing><br>
    The fundamental equation of the finite element method is [K]{ u} = {
    F}, where [K] is the stiffness matrix, {u} is the displacement vector, and {F}
    is the applied load vector. This is analogous to a simple spring (Fig. 1.3) that
    obeys Hooke’s Law (stress = Young’s modulus x strain), and is the essence of
    “small deflection theory”, or linear analysis. Small deflection theory means
    that the displacement calculated for the applied load can be extrapolated to
    any value of load, and that the stiffness of the structure does not change for
    any value of applied load. Strictly speaking, this assumption is never exactly
    true, but for a very large class of analyses it has traditionally been considered
    good enough.<br>

    <custom-heading level="2">1.2 Introduction to ANSYS</custom-heading><br>
    Engineers can perform the following tasks using finite element analysis
    software ANSYS:
    <ul>
        <li>Transferring CAD models of structures, products, components, or
        systems or building computer models</li>
        <li>Applying design performance conditions or working loads</li>
        <li>Studying responses, such as stress levels or temperature distributions</li>
        <li>Optimizing a design</li>
        <li>Do prototype testing in situations where it otherwise would be
        impossible.</li>
    </ul>

    5

    The ANSYS offers a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that permits easy,
    interactive access to functions, commands and documentation. An intuitive
    menu system helps the analyst steer through the ANSYS program. S/he can
    input data using a mouse, a keyboard, or both.
    This chapter provides basic guidelines for using the ANSYS program:
    starting and stopping the analysis, using the online help system, using and
    customizing the GUI, etc.<br>

    <custom-heading level="2">1.3 Mechanical APDL Environment</custom-heading><br>
    There are two basic levels in ANSYS - Begin level and Processor level.
    The <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor> acts as a doorway into and out of the program. It is also used
    for performing operations such as changing the jobname, clearing the
    database, and copying binary files. When the analyst first enters the program,
    s/he is at the <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor>.
    At the <custom-processor>Processor level</custom-processor>, many processors are available. Each processor
    is a set of functions that performs a specific analysis task. The model is built
    in the general preprocessor (PREP7). Loads are applied and the solution is
    obtained in the solution processor (SOLUTION). The results of a solution are
    assessed in the general postprocessor (POST1). An additional postprocessor,
    POST26, permits to evaluate solution results at specific points in the model as
    a function of time.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.1 Entering a Processor</sub-heading><br>
    Select a processor to enter it from the Main Menu of the GUI. Choose
    <custom-process>Main Menu> Preprocessor</custom-process> to enter into PREP7.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.2 Exiting from a Processor or from the Program</sub-heading><br>
    Pick <custom-process>Main Menu> Finish</custom-process> to return to the <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor> from a processor.
    Without returning to the <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor>, the user can move from one processor
    to another. Simply pick the processor necessary to do so.
    <custom-spacing>Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Exit</custom-process> to leave ANSYS. By default, ANSYS
    saves the model and loads automatically and writes them to the database
    file, Jobname.DB. If a backup of the current database file already exists,
    ANSYS writes it to Jobname.DBB. Other portions of the database can be
    saved using options in the dialog box. The user can as well quit without
    saving.<br></custom-spacing>
    In order to input a new file, select <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Clear & Start
    New</custom-process> to clear the current file from memory, then select a file to input. In order
    to return to processing the original file, select <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Read
    Input from...</custom-process>, select the name of the file to resume from and select
    the <custom-process>OK</custom-process>button.
    <custom-spacing>The processing of an input file can be stopped as it is being input. Most
    files will display the Process Status window at the top of the screen. Use
    the <custom-process>STOP</custom-process> button on the Process Status window to terminate the input of a
    file. Stopping file input is useful when a binary file is input unintentionally.<br></custom-spacing>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3 The Database</sub-heading><br>
    ANSYS stores all input data and results data in one large database in
    an structured manner. The main advantage of the database is any specific
    data item can quickly and easily be listed, displayed, modified, or deleted.
    No matter which processor the analyst is in, s/he works with the same
    database. This gives basic access to the model and loads portions of the
    database from anywhere in the program. "Basic access" refers the ability to
    select, list, or display an item.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3.1 Defining or Deleting Database Items</sub-heading><br>
    The analyst must be in the right processor to define or delete items
    from the database. Nodes, elements, and other geometry can be defined
    only in PREP7, the general preprocessor. Loads can be specified and applied
    in either the PREP7 or the SOLUTION processor. However, geometry items
    can be selected, listed, or displayed from anywhere in ANSYS.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3.2 Saving the Database</sub-heading><br>
    The analyst should frequently save copies of database to a file as it
    contains all the input data. Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Save as Jobname.DB</custom-process> to
    do this. This choice writes the database to the file Jobname.DB. <custom-process>SAVE</custom-process>
    command has the following options:
    <ul>
        <li>the model data only</li>
        <li>the model and solution data</li>
        <li>the model, solution and preprocessing data.</li>
    </ul>
    Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Save as</custom-process> to specify a different file name. Any
    save operation first writes a backup of the present database file
    to Jobname.DBB. If a Jobname.DBB file already exists, the new backup file
    overwrites it.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3.3 Restoring Database Contents</sub-heading><br>
    Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Resume Jobname.DB</custom-process> to restore data from
    the database file. This reads the file Jobname.DB. Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File>
    Resume from</custom-process> to specify a different file name.
    The database can be saved or resumed from anywhere in ANSYS,
    including the <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor>. A resume operation replaces the data currently in
    memory with the data in the named database file. Using the save and resume
    operations together is helpful when "testing" a function or command.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3.4 Session Editor</sub-heading><br>
    During an analysis, it may be necessary to modify or delete commands
    entered since the last <custom-process>SAVE</custom-process> or <custom-process>RESUME</custom-process>. The session editor is used for
    displaying and editing the sequence of operations performed since the last
    <custom-process>SAVE</custom-process> or <custom-process>RESUME</custom-process> command. The analyst can modify command parameters,
    delete whole sections of text or save a portion of the command string to a
    separate file. The session editor (Fig. 1.4) can be accessed by choosing
    <custom-process>Main Menu> Session Editor</custom-process>.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="4.jpg" alt="image" width="150"></span>
        <span><img src="5.jpg" alt="image" width="300"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.4 The Session Editor</image-tag><br>

    The following file operations are available in the session editor:
    <ul>
        <li>OK: Enters the series of operations displayed in the window below.
        Use this option to input the command sequence after modifying it</li>
        <li>Save: Saves the command sequence displayed in the window
        below to a separate file. The program names the
        file Jobnam000.cmds, with each subsequent save operation
        incrementing the filename by one digit The INPUT command is
        used to reenter the saved file</li>
        <li>Cancel: Dismisses this window and returns to the program</li>
        <li>Help: Displays the command reference for the UNDO command.</li>
    </ul>
    The Session Editor is available in GUI mode only. It is a powerful
    ANSYS Undo. ANSYS keeps a running copy of the log file from the last save
    command. By modifying the values in the Session Editor window and clicking
    OK, the modified commands are read back into ANSYS. If
    no SAVE or RESUME command has been issued during the analysis, all
    commands from the current session will be executed, including
    the start160.ans file, if present.<br>

    <sub-heading>1.3.3.5 Clearing the Database</sub-heading><br>
    In building a model, sometimes it may be necessary to clear out the
    database contents and start afresh. Choose <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Clear &
    Start New</custom-process> to do so. This method clears the database stored in memory.
    Clearing the database has the same effect as leaving and re-entering the
    program, but does not require to exit.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.4 Program Files</sub-heading><br>
    The program writes and reads many files for data storage and
    retrieval. File names follow this pattern: Name.Ext. Name defaults to the
    jobname, which the analyst specifies while entering the program or by
    choosing <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Change Jobname</custom-process>. The default jobname
    is FILE (or file). Ext is a unique, two- to four-character identifier that
    identifies the contents of the file. For example, Jobname.DB is the database
    file, Jobname.EMAT is the element matrix file, and Jobname.GRPH is the
    neutral graphics file.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.4.1 File Types</sub-heading><br>
    The filename can contain up to 248 characters, including the directory
    name, and the extension can contain up to eight characters. ANSYS can
    process blanks in file or directory names, so blank spaces are permitted in
    object names. When an object has a blank space in its name, always enclose
    the name in a pair of single quotes.
    Use back slashes (\) instead of (/) slashes in directory names. For
    example, a typical directory path looks like this:
    <image-tag>C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\ANSYS
    Student\v201\ANSYS\apdl\start.ans</image-tag><br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.4.2 The Jobname.LOG File</sub-heading><br>
    The Jobname.LOG file (the session log) is mainly important, as it
    provides a complete log of the session. This file opens immediately when the
    analyst enters ANSYS, and it records all commands executed. S/he can read
    the Jobname.LOG file, view it while in ANSYS, edit it, and input it later.<br>
    The program always appends log data to the log file instead of
    overwriting it. If the analyst changes the jobname while in a session, the log
    file name does not change to the new jobname.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5 Communicating with ANSYS</sub-heading><br>
    The easiest way to communicate with the ANSYS is by using the
    intuitive menu system, called the GUI.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5.1 Communicating via the GUI</sub-heading><br>
    The GUI consists of windows, menus, dialog boxes and other
    components that permits to feed input data and execute functions simply by
    picking buttons with a mouse or typing in responses to prompts. All users,
    both beginner and advanced, find it convenient to use the GUI for interactive
    work.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5.2 Communicating Via Commands</sub-heading><br>
    Commands are the instructions that instruct the program. The
    program offers numerous commands, each meant for a specific function. Most
    commands are allied with specific processors, and work in respective
    processor(s). The analyst can either type in the appropriate command or
    access that function from the GUI to use it.
    Program commands have a specific format. A typical command consists
    of a command name in the first field, usually followed by a comma and
    several more fields (containing arguments). A comma separates each field.
    For example, the F command, which applies a force at a node, looks like this:
    F commmand
    <image-tag>F,NODE,Lab,VALUE</image-tag>
    To apply an X-direction force of 2000 at node number 376, the F command
    would read as follows:
    <image-tag>F,376,FX,2000</image-tag>
    Command arguments may take a number or an alphanumeric labels,
    depending on their function. In the F command example described
    previously, NODE and VALUE are numeric arguments, but Lab is an
    alphanumeric argument. In this book, numeric arguments appear in all
    uppercase italic letters (as in NODE and VALUE), and alphanumeric arguments
    appear in initial uppercase italic format (as in Lab).<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5.3 Abbreviations</sub-heading><br>
    If a GUI function is used frequently, it can be renamed or abbreviated
    to a string of up to eight alphanumeric characters using: <custom-process>Utility Menu>
    Macro> Edit Abbreviations</custom-process> or <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Edit Toolbar</custom-process>. In
    the GUI, abbreviations appear as push buttons on the Toolbar. They can be
    executed with a quick click of the mouse.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5.4 Command Macro Files</sub-heading><br>
    A frequently used sequence of commands can be recorded in a macro
    file, thus creating a custom command. If an unrecognized command is
    entered, the program searches for a macro file by that name (with an
    extension of .MAC or .mac).<br>
    <custom-heading level="2">1.4 Running the ANSYS Program</custom-heading level='2'><br>
    The ANSYS program can be run in interactive mode or in batch mode.
    In interactive mode, the analyst exchanges information with the program
    continuously. A command can be executed by selecting its menu path in the
    GUI or by typing it in directly. The ANSYS program processes the command in
    real time. Interactive mode permits to use the GUI, online help, and various
    tools to create the model in the graphics window and modify it.
    In batch mode, a file of commands is submitted to the ANSYS. A batch
    job can be run in the background while doing other work on the system.
    Batch mode is useful when there is no need to interact with the program,
    such as during the solution phase. The ANSYS Launcher can be used to set
    options for an ANSYS run.<br>

    The File Management Tab
    This tab contains the information necessary to manage the files, such
    as location of the working directory and job name. The available options will
    differ depending on the simulation environment selected. In
    the ANSYS simulation environment, the analyst can specify:
    Working directory
    Sets the directory in which the ANSYS run will be executed. The
    program writes files it generates to this directory. Type the new directory
    name in the Working Directory text box to change the working directory or
    press the <custom-process>Browse</custom-process> button to display a file selection dialog box. The working
    directory can be specified by defining the
    ANSYS201_WORKING_DIRECTORY environment variable. If
    ANSYS201_WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, the launcher will use that setting
    as the default. However, any working directory that is specified via the
    launcher (such as a profile) overrides the
    ANSYS201_WORKING_DIRECTORY environment variable setting.<br>
    Jobname
    Defines the base filename used for all files generated by the ANSYS
    run. The initial jobname defaults to file. It can be changed to any
    alphanumeric string up to 32 characters long.
    The Customization/Preferences Tab
    The settings under this tab permit to specify detailed settings about
    the working environment, such as memory settings, parallel/distributed
    processing settings, custom executables, and additional parameters. The
    available options will differ depending on the simulation environment
    selected on the first tab.
    On selecting the ANSYS or ANSYS Batch simulation environment, the
    analyst can specify:
    Custom Memory Settings
    Specifies the use of custom memory settings rather than using the
    default memory model. Select custom memory settings in order to set the -
    m or -db options.
    Total Workspace (MB)
    Specifies the initial allocation of memory requested for the ANSYS run.
    It defaults to 2 GB (2048 MB). This value is adequate for most modest-sized
    models.
    Database (MB)
    Specifies the portion of total memory that the database will use for the
    initial allocation. It defaults to 1GB (1024 MB). This value is adequate for
    most modest-sized models.
    Graphics Device Name
    Sets the graphics device (Fig. 1.6). The GUI requires a terminal that
    supports graphics. The graphics device can be WIN32 (default), WIN32c, or
    3D. The 3D graphics driver facilitates to rotate a shaded view of the model.
    Most newer graphics cards can handle this well.<br>

    the start201.ans file. Uncheck the box to not read the start201.ans at
    start-up.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.4.1.2 Launcher Menu Options</sub-heading><br>
    Launcher-specific controls can be found under different launcher menu
    options. The menu options are:
    File: Use the <custom-process>File</custom-process> menu to exit.
    Profiles: Use the <custom-process>Profiles</custom-process> menu to save a specific launcher configuration. The
    profile the analyst is currently running is displayed in the launcher title bar. An
    asterisk (*) follows the profile name if any settings are changed from what is
    saved.
    <ul>
        <li>Click <custom-process>Save Profile</custom-process> to save the current launcher configurations. A
        name can be entered for this profile. The last run profile will
        automatically be set as the default unless the analyst specifies
        otherwise. Check the <custom-process>Set as Default</custom-process> box to set a subsequent profile
        as the default .</li>
        <li>Click <custom-process>Load Profile</custom-process> to select the last run profile or one of the saved
        profiles.</li>
        <li>Click <custom-process>Manage Profiles</custom-process> to rename a profile, specify a different
        default profile, unset a default profile, or delete a profile.</li>
    </ul>
    If the analyst chooses to use the detailed working directory
    browse dialog box, it shows what files are contained in each directory,
    allows creating a new directory, and allows filtering on file type. The
    standard browse dialog displays only the directories from which to
    choose.
    By default, the launcher saves existing output files from batch
    runs. When a new file is created, the old one is renamed
    to jobname.out.<timestamp> when the batch job is started. The
    timestamp is in the format YYYY-MM-DD@hh_mm_ss and reflects the
    date that the file was renamed, not the date the original file was
    created. Uncheck the <custom-process>Save Existing Output Files From Batch
    Runs</custom-process> item under the <custom-process>Options</custom-process> menu on the launcher to overwrite the
    output file rather than renaming it.
    Use the <custom-process>Reset ANSYS GUI Configuration</custom-process> option to return the
    ANSYS GUI to its default configuration if the menus or toolbars have
    been rearranged. This option is especially useful if an ANSYS GUI
    component has been moved out of the screen's viewable area.
    The <custom-process>Delete All Settings/Profiles</custom-process> option deletes all profiles
    saved for this release and sets all <custom-process>Options</custom-process> menu settings back to the
    defaults. The launcher will also close automatically.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.4.2 Interactive Mode</sub-heading><br>
    In interactive mode, the analyst works with menus and dialog boxes to

    </ul>
    <custom-heading level="2">1.5 GUI</custom-heading level='2'><br>
    The GUI is an easy and intuitive way to interact with the program. The
    GUI mode is often referred to as interactive mode. The GUI allows to perform
    an analysis interactively with little or no knowledge of individual commands.
    Each GUI option activates one or more commands to perform the requested
    operation. Most operations can be performed interactively, but some
    operations are available only by entering commands in the command input
    area or via a batch file. The program records all commands issued in the
    input history file (Jobname.LOG).<br>

    ANSYS can be run through the GUI and commands input window, or
    by creating an ASCII text file for input, or both. It is often more desirable to
    use a combination of both graphical methods and input files. An input file is
    often useful for defining the initial model geometry, characteristics, and
    constraints. This is because the input file can be easily changed to correct the
    errors that are inevitable when setting up a new ANSYS model. Once the
    input is correct and the model geometry and material characteristics are read
    into ANSYS, it is then desirable to examine the results using either direct
    command input with the command input window, or the graphical menu
    selections.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.5.1 GUI Components</sub-heading><br>
    Dialog boxes are used to provide input for a particular function. The
    type of dialog box provided depends on the type of input required. The input
    might require any of the following: text entry box, check button, radio button,
    option button, single-selection list, multiple-selection list, two-column
    selection list, a tabbed box, or a tree structure. Other components of a dialog
    box include action buttons such as OK, Apply, and Cancel.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.5.1.1 Text Entry Boxes</sub-heading><br>
    In a text entry box (Fig. 1.7) numbers or character strings are
    entered. If text already exists in the text entry box, overwrite it by
    highlighting the existing text. Press and drag the left mouse button to
    highlight existing text. Double-clicking the left mouse button on a word
    highlights the word, and triple-clicking it highlights the entire string.<br>

    <sub-heading>1.5.1.3 Radio Buttons</sub-heading><br>
    Radio buttons are diamond shaped buttons used to select one of
    several options. One button is always "On" in a set of radio buttons. Clicking
    on the desired item makes that button active and turns off other buttons. The
    buttons shown under "Structural discipline options" (Fig. 1.8) are radio
    buttons.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.5.1.4 Option Buttons</sub-heading><br>
    With option buttons (Fig. 1.9) the analyst selects an item from a pop-
    up menu that collapses into one button showing the active choice. Adopt the
    following procedure to select a different option:
    1. Place the cursor on the button
    2. Press the left mouse button and hold it
    3. Drag the mouse through the pop-up menu until the desired item is
    highlighted.<br>

    <sub-heading>1.5.1.5 Single-Selection Lists</sub-heading><br>
    A single-selection list (Fig. 1.10) is used to select one option from a
    scrollable list. Clicking on the desired item highlights it and copies it to the
    Selection box, where it can be edited.<br>

    <sub-heading>1.5.1.6 Multiple-Selection Lists</sub-heading><br>
    A multiple-selection list (Fig. 1.11) is used to select items from a list. It
    resembles the single-selection list except that there is no Selection box, and
    more than one item can be selected. Clicking on an item highlights and makes
    it active, and clicking the same item again deactivates it.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="12.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>

    <sub-heading>1.5.1.7 Two-Column Selection Lists</sub-heading><br>
    One of several choices can be selected from a two-column selection list
    (Fig. 1.12). It resembles the single-selection list except the choices are
    grouped into categories. Select a category from the left column, then pick the
    desired item from the right column. Choices available in the right column vary
    according to the choice in the left column.
    The GUI displays this type of list primarily when it is necessary to
    select from a large number of items.<br>

    <sub-heading>1.5.1.8 Tabbed Dialog Boxes</sub-heading><br>
    A tabbed dialog box (Fig. 1.13) presents groups of related commands
    in one location. Select an individual tab by clicking on it, or by
    using Ctrl+Tab to move between the tabs. Some tabbed dialog boxes require
    that the analyst navigates through each tab sequentially, with later tabs
    “grayed out” until s/he completes required tasks in an earlier tab.<br>

    <sub-heading>1.5.1.10 Tree Structures</sub-heading><br>
    A tree structure (Fig. 1.15) presents a hierarchical flow of logical
    choices from major categories to specific subcategories. Select a major
    category by double-clicking on the category. Subcategories appear listed
    vertically and indented beneath that major category. If a subcategory is
    selected in the same way, further subcategories are listed, and become more
    specific. Continually selecting subcategories yields the final item in the
    “branch” of the tree. At this point, instead of a categorical choice, enter or
    edit data to provide specific input.<br>
    <div class="container-1">

    <image-tag>Fig. 1.16 Sample Data Input Dialog Box</image-tag><br>

    <sub-heading>1.5.1.11 Using Action Buttons</sub-heading><br>
    A dialog box typically contains combinations of the following action
    buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>OK - Applies the changes and closes the dialog box.</li>
        <li>Apply - Applies changes but does not close the dialog box. Use this
        button when it is necessary to make more than one change within a
        dialog box, or when it is necessary to execute a function more than
        once.</li>
        <li>Reset - The settings in the dialog box revert to the previous or default
        settings.</li>
        <li>Cancel - Closes the dialog box without applying any changes made.
        The difference between Cancel and Reset is that Reset does not
        close the dialog box.</li>
        <li>Help - Displays help information for the function being performed.</li>
    </ul>
    <sub-heading>1.5.2 Layout of the GUI</sub-heading><br>
    If the analyst enters the program through the launcher, the GUI is
    activated automatically for interactive running. The GUI (Fig. 1.17) has seven
    areas:<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="18.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.17 The Program GUI replace</image-tag><br>
    1. <b>Utility Menu</b> - Contains functions that are available throughout the
    ANSYS session, such as file controls, selections, graphic controls and
    parameters. The analyst can also exit the program through this menu.
    <br>2. <b>Standard Toolbar</b> - Contains push buttons that execute commonly
    used ANSYS commands. More push buttons can be added if desired.
    <br>3. <b>Command Input Area</b> - Shows program prompt messages and
    allows analyst to type in commands directly.
    <br>4. <b>Main Menu</b> - Contains the primary ANSYS functions, organized by
    preprocessor, solution, general postprocessor, design optimizer. It is
    from this menu that the vast majority of modelling commands are
    issued.
    <br>5. <b>Graphics Window</b> - The Graphic Window is where graphics are
    shown and graphical picking can be made. It is here where analyst will
    graphically view the model in its various stages of construction and the
    ensuing results from the analysis.
    <br>6. <b>Status and Prompt Area</b> - located at the bottom of the GUI, shows
    prompts and the status of the analysis. Typically, prompts for functions
    that involve graphical picking will be seen. Be sure to read the prompt
    so the proper entities can be picked in the proper order. This area also
    contains status information.
    <br>7. <b>Output Window</b> - The Output Window (Fig. 1.18) shows text output
    from the program, such as listing of data etc. It is usually positioned
    behind the main window and can be put to the front if necessary.
    The GUI is fairly easy to use. There is some terminology related to
    basic operation:<br>

    <custom-spacing><custom-style>Resume:</custom-style> Resume opens a previously saved database. Resuming a
    database doesn’t change the jobname. For example: start ANSYS with
    a jobname of file. Then resume example.db, do some work, then save.
    That save is done to file.db! This can be avoided by always resuming
    using the <img src="19.jpg" alt="image">icon on the toolbar. If example.db is opened using this
    method, it resumes the model and automatically changes the jobname
    to example.</custom-spacing>
    <custom-spacing><custom-style>Plotting:</custom-style> Contrary to the name, this has nothing to do with sending an
    image to a plotter or printer. Plotting in ANSYS refers to drawing
    something in the graphics window. Plot one type of entity (lines,
    elements, etc.) to the screen at a time. To plot more than one kind of
    entity use, <custom-process>“Plot > Multiplot”</custom-process>, which by default will plot everything in
    the model at once.</custom-spacing>
    <custom-spacing><custom-style>Plot Controls:</custom-style>his refers to how the “plot” has to look on the screen
    (shaded, wireframe, entity numbers on or off, etc). Other plot control
    functions include sending an image to a graphics file or printer.</custom-spacing>
    <custom-spacing><custom-style>Raise hidden:</custom-style> If a dialog box disappears behind the main window, bring
    it back with this.<br></custom-spacing>

    <image-tag>Fig. 1.18 Output Window</image-tag><br>

    The analyst can resize the toolbar, Main Menu and Graphics Window,
    as well as the GUI. In order to resize the areas in the GUI, drag the borders
    around the areas of the GUI while holding down the left mouse button.<br>
    In order to change the overall size of the GUI, position the mouse on
    of the corners of the GUI and drag it diagonally towards the center of the GUI
    while holding down the left mouse button. Save the GUI size settings by
    selecting <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Save Menu Layout</custom-process>.<br>
    The GUI iconified. Later to completely remove the program from the
    screen without terminating the session, the session can be brought back by
    restoring the icon. The remainder of this section describes each of the areas
    of the GUI.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.5.2.1 The Utility Menu</sub-heading><br>
    The Utility Menu contains utility functions such as file controls,
    selecting, graphics controls, and parameters. Most of these functions can be
    executed anytime during the session. For example, while picking locations on
    the working plane to create keypoints, the analyst can select <custom-process>Utility Menu>
    PlotCtrls> Pan-Zoom-Rotate> Iso</custom-process> to change the view to an isometric view.<br>
    Each menu topic on the Utility Menu brings up a pull-down menu of
    subtopics, which in turn either cascade to a submenu (indicated by a >) or
    perform an action. The action may do any of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Immediately execute a function</li>
        <li>Bring up a dialog box (indicated by a ...)</li>
        <li>Bring up a picking menu (indicated by a +).</li>
    </ul>
    Figure 1.19 shows the pull-down list of subtopics seen when
    the List topic is selected:<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="21.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.19 Example of a Pull-Down, Cascading Menu</image-tag><br>

    Left mouse button is used to "pull down" a menu topic on the Utility
    Menu. Pressing and dragging the mouse button permits to move rapidly to
    the desired subtopic. Releasing the mouse button while it is on an "action"
    subtopic causes the program to perform that action. Clicking the left mouse
    button leaves the pull-down and cascading menus in place. The menus
    disappear when the analyst clicks on an action subtopic or elsewhere in the
    GUI.<br>
    Use the keyboard to pull down a menu topic and move to the desired
    function. Do so via the menu's mnemonic character, indicated by an
    underscore. Simply place the mouse cursor anywhere in the Utility Menu and
    press the ALT key and the mnemonic character simultaneously. For example,
    pressing ALT+F with the mouse cursor anywhere in the Utility Menu pulls
    down the File menu, since F is the mnemonic (indicated by the underscore
    in File).<br>
    Once the pull-down menu appears, the analyst can use the other
    mnemonic characters (without the ALT) or the arrow keys on the keyboard to
    navigate to the desired menu topic and the ENTER or RETURN key to "pick"
    it.<br>
    The Utility Menu lists 10 topics. A brief description of each topic
    follows.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>File - Contains file and database related functions, such as clearing the
        database, saving it to a file, and resuming it from a file. Some of the
        functions under the File menu are valid at Begin level only. If the
        analyst selects such a function when not at Begin level, s/he will see a
        dialog box giving a choice of moving to Begin level and executing the
        function or cancelling the function.</li>
        <li>Select - Includes functions that allow to select subsets of entities and
        to create components.</li>
        <li>List - Enables to list virtually any data item stored in the database. The
        analyst can also obtain status information about different areas of the
        program and list the contents of files residing on the system.</li>
        <li>Plot - Plots keypoints, lines, areas, volumes, nodes, elements, and
        other data that can be graphically displayed.</li>
        <li>PlotCtrls - Includes functions which control the view, style, and other
        characteristics of graphics displays.</li>
        <li>The Hard Copy function helps in obtaining hard copies of the entire
        screen or just the Graphics Window.</li>
        <li>WorkPlane - Enables to toggle the working plane on or off and to
        move, rotate, and otherwise maneuver the working plane. The analyst
        can also create, delete, and switch coordinate systems by using this
        menu.</li>
        <li>Parameters - Includes functions to define, edit, and delete scalar and
        array parameters.</li>
        <li>Macro - Allows to execute macros and data blocks. The analyst can
        also create, edit, and delete abbreviations, which appear as push
        buttons on the Toolbar.</li>
        <li>MenuCtrls - Permits to create, edit, and delete abbreviations on the
        Toolbar Once the analyst adjusts the GUI to her/his liking, s/he can
        use the Save Menu Layout function to save the current GUI
        configuration.</li>
    </ul>
    <sub-heading>1.5.2.2 The Standard Toolbar</sub-heading><br>
    The Standard Toolbar (Fig. 1.20) contains a set of icon buttons that
    execute commonly -used functions.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="22.jpg" alt="image" width="700px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.20 Standard Toolbar</image-tag><br>

    By default, the Standard Toolbar is loaded and positioned when the
    analyst starts ANSYS. The Standard Toolbar is defined at start up, and cannot
    be modified during the session. The standard buttons and their functions
    include:
    <ul>
        <li>New Analysis: Saves and clears information for the existing analysis and
        starts a new analysis.</li>
        <li>Open File: Reads database or input files to be read into ANSYS. The file type
        determines the operation.</li>
        <li>Save Analysis: Saves the current analysis to a database file.</li>
        <li>Pan-Zoom-Rotate: Opens the Pan-Zoom-Rotate dialog box.</li>
        <li>Image Capture: Opens the image capture GUI.</li>
        <li>Report Generator: Opens the report generator GUI.</li>
        <li>Help: Displays the table of contents for the HTML-based help.</li>
        <li>Raise Hidden: Raises hidden windows to the top of the application.</li>
        <li>Reset Picking: Resets the picking menu if it becomes unresponsive or does
        not appear when invoked via a menu pick or a command in the Input
        Window.</li>
        <li>Contact Manager: Opens the Contact Manager GUI.</li>
    </ul>
    <sub-heading>1.5.2.3 Command Input Options</sub-heading><br>
    Although the GUI provides intuitive graphical access, the analyst can
    provide input to the program by typing in commands, even while the GUI is
    active. There are two modes available for directly entering commands during
    the analysis. The Single Line Input Window displays only one line and uses a
    drop-down window to display the command history. The Command Window
    can be used for more intensive command operations, such as pasting in
    multiple command strings or copying longer strings and selected commands
    from the history window. Both modes are described below.<br>
    The Single Line Input Window<br>

    The Input Window (Fig. 1.21) is the default display for all GUI
    operations. The Input Window is used to conveniently enter single
    commands. It is also used to access the history buffer without changing the
    overall configuration of the GUI. As commands are entered into the Input
    Window, dynamic command help appears in a box above the window. As the
    analyst types the letters, the command help displays the possible commands,
    and guides through the proper spelling and syntax of the command.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="23.jpg" alt="image" width="700px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.21 Single Line Input Window</image-tag><br>

    The history buffer contains all previously entered commands. Individual
    lines from the history buffer can be displayed in the Input Window and
    indexed with the up or down arrow keyboard keys. Once displayed in the
    window, the analyst can edit the entry and execute it by using the return key.
    View and access the history buffer by clicking the down arrow on the
    right of the text entry box. A drop down list containing the entry history
    appears. Clicking the left mouse button on any line in the history buffer
    moves that line to the text entry box where the analyst can edit and execute
    it. A double click on any line in the history buffer automatically executes that
    line.<br>
    The vertical scroll bar at the right corner of the (unhighlighted) history
    buffer box allows to scroll through the history buffer. The up and down arrow
    keys can also be used to navigate the history buffer.<br>
    The Floating Command Window<br>
    Bring the Floating Command Window (Fig. 1.22) up by clicking on the
    keyboard icon at the left side of the Single Line Input Window. The Command
    Window is a floating window that can be resized and positioned easily for
    more complex command entry operations. When the command window is
    closed, all the operations will appear in the history buffer.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="24.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.22 The Floating Command Window</image-tag><br>

    When the command history is accessed with the command window,
    select commands from the buffer, and selectively enter them into input line,
    in any order of selection. Do this by holding down the <custom-process>Ctrl</custom-process> key and clicking on
    each command. As this is done, the commands appear in the input line
    below. Then edit the commands, changing parameters or syntax, before
    hitting enter to execute them.<br>
    The size and location of the Floating Command Window can be set to
    the desired orientation. Then use the <custom-process>“Save Menu Layout”</custom-process> feature to make it
    default. The Single Line Window will be available when the Command Window
    is closed, but will no longer be the default.<br>
    The Command Window provides a scrollable, editable text area where
    individual commands can be entered or pasted in long command strings.
    Multiple commands can also be selected from the history buffer area, either
    using the shift key to select large contiguous portions of the history, or the
    control key to select multiple, individual commands. Like the Input Window,
    dynamic command help is available; as command is typed, the probable
    command is displayed. This display shows the complete command syntax,
    and stays visible so that the help system can be checked.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.5.2.4 The Toolbar</sub-heading><br>
    The Toolbar (Fig. 1.23) is a convenient area where push-buttons can
    be added for command, function and macro shortcuts. The Toolbar is a set of
    push buttons that execute commonly used functions. The toolbar can be set
    up to provide one-button access to the favorite and frequently used functions.
    It is loaded and positioned by default, and can be modified during the
    session. Some push buttons are predefined, but all others are to be defined
    by the analyst. That is, the analyst selects how many push buttons the
    Toolbar contains (to a maximum of 100) and what functions they execute.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="25.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.23 The Toolbar</image-tag><br>

    <b>Adding Buttons to the Toolbar</b>
    Additional push buttons are added to the Toolbar by creating
    abbreviations. An abbreviation is simply an alias (up to 32 characters long) for
    a complete command or GUI function name. For example, <custom-style>SAVE_DB</custom-style> is an
    alias for the <custom-process>SAVE</custom-process> command and <custom-style>RESUM_DB</custom-style> is an alias for the
    <custom-process>RESUME</custom-process> command. Macros can also be added to the Toolbar by defining an
    abbreviation that executes the macro.<br>
    Creating Abbreviations
    Select <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Edit Toolbar</custom-process> or <custom-process>Macro> Edit
    Abbreviations</custom-process> to create an abbreviation. Both menu choices bring up the
    "Edit Toolbar/Abbreviations" dialog box shown in Fig. 1.24. The Toolbar
    immediately reflects any changes the analyst makes to the abbreviations
    using this dialog box.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="26.jpg" alt="image" width="250px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.24 Edit Toolbar / Abbreviations Dialog Box</image-tag><br>

    An abbreviation can also be created by issuing the <custom-process>*ABBR</custom-process> command
    from the Input Window. In this method, it is necessary to update the Toolbar
    manually by picking <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Update Toolbar</custom-process>. The Toolbar
    can be sized to make it smaller or larger to fit the set of abbreviations.<br>
    The order in which abbreviations are defined determines the placement
    of the buttons on the Toolbar. After defining the buttons, they cannot be
    rearranged graphically within the GUI.<br>
    Buttons that execute commands or functions from a processor other
    than the current one will not work. For example, if the analyst is in PREP7 and
    picks a button for a POST1 command, s/he will receive an "unrecognized
    PREP7 command..." warning.<br>
    After creating own set of abbreviations in the Toolbar, the analyst can
    save them in a file by choosing either <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Save
    Toolbar</custom-process> or <custom-process>Utility Menu> Macro> Save Abbr</custom-process>. Pick either <custom-process>Utility Menu>
    MenuCtrls> Restore Toolbar</custom-process> or <custom-process>Utility Menu> Macro> Restore Abbr</custom-process> to
    restore a set of abbreviations from a file.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.5.2.5 Main Menu</sub-heading><br>
    The Main Menu (Fig. 1.25) is where the analyst begins the analysis. It
    contains the analysis functions used to create the model. The Main Menu is
    arranged in a tree structure. This structure has progressive submenus
    accessible as the analyst proceeds through the steps of the analysis. Each
    menu topic in the main menu either expands to show more menu options
    (indicated by a boxed +) or performs an action (indicated by an icon
    preceding the menu topic). Click on the boxed + or the topic name to expand
    a menu topic to reveal the subtopics (the boxed + will turn into a boxed -).
    Continue expanding subtopics (also indicated by a boxed +) until the desired
    action is reached. The action name is preceded by an icon used to indicate
    the action:
    <ul>
        <li>A square for a dialog box</li>
        <li>An arrow for a picking menu.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="27.jpg" alt="image" width="250px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.25 Main Menu</image-tag><br>

    <b>Using Preferences to Set Menu Content</b>
    One of the most useful customizations that can be performed from the
    GUI is to apply filtering to the menu choices. Filtering lets grey out, or
    completely hide many of the functions the analyst determines s/he won’t
    need during the analysis. Use the preferences dialog box to adjust the
    filtering.<br>
    At the start of the program, no filtering is applied. Menu choices for all
    analysis disciplines are displayed. Menu items that are not applicable are
    grayed out, based on the context of the analysis. The grayed out items can
    be removed by choosing the appropriate discipline from within the
    <custom-process>“Preferences for GUI Filtering”</custom-process> dialog box. Not all menu options may be visible
    during the analysis. If the desired option is not available, check the
    preferences and element types.<br>
    For example, selecting Thermal suppresses structural, magnetic, and
    fluid element types in the <custom-process>“Element Types”</custom-process> dialog box, displacements, and
    potentials, etc. In the <custom-process>“Apply Loads”</custom-process> and <custom-process>“Delete Loads”</custom-process> menus, and so on.
    Another item is the methodology used for structural analysis: h-method or LS-
    DYNA Explicit. By default, the program uses h-method. The analyst can also
    change the menu hierarchy and customize it to her/his needs by using the
    User Interface Design Language (UIDL), an ANSYS-developed GUI language.<br>
    <sub-heading>Additional Usability Features</sub-heading><br>
    On opening a Main Menu topic, the submenus stay in place until the
    analyst selects a different Main Menu topic. If a menu topic is not seen, scroll
    up or down in the Main Menu area until it is found or click the boxed – to
    collapse subtopics that are no longer in use.<br>
    Individual topics in the Main Menu can be completely expanded to
    reveal each and every subtopic. Right-mouse click context-sensitive control is
    available within the Main Menu to expand and collapse the individual topics.
    Once an individual subtopic is completely expanded, the analyst can
    selectively close topics to have areas at different locations under each main
    topic expanded. As s/he does so, the amount of expansion accessed is
    recorded and replicated in the next time.<br>
    Menus can be set to automatically collapse and expand the subtopics.
    Use the <custom-process>“Collapse Siblings”</custom-process> feature (found in the right-mouse click menu) to
    set the menu expansion preferences. When collapse is selected, the subtopics
    opened automatically collapse when another main topic is selected.<br>
    When many submenus are open, navigating the main menu can
    become confusing, especially when individual submenus are large enough to
    push the heading out of the viewing area. The Preprocessor subtopic alone
    has more than 800 nested subheadings beneath it. Use the same right-mouse
    click context-sensitive control to configure the main menu for selectable
    contrasting color display within each nested level. Designate any color for the
    menu text at each level, making the transition between levels easily
    detectable. This makes navigating within a subtopic, and up to higher levels
    much easier.<br>
    <sub-heading>Main Menu Analysis Functions</sub-heading><br>
    Most of the functions in the main menu are <custom-style>“modal”</custom-style> with respect to
    each other; that is, the analyst must complete one function before starting
    the next. For example, for creating keypoints on the working plane, s/he
    cannot simultaneously create lines or mesh volumes. However, s/he can
    define or edit scalar parameters in the middle of creating keypoints since
    parameter functions are <custom-style>“modeless”</custom-style> Utility Menu functions.<br>
    The Main Menu functions will vary according to the product and type of
    analysis. The following functions are included in the default, non-filtered Main
    Menu:
    <ul>
        <li><custom-processor>Preprocessor</custom-processor> – Enters the modelling processor and contains <custom-processor>PREP7</custom-processor>
        functions such as modelling, meshing, and loads.</li>
        <li><custom-processor>Solution</custom-processor> – Enters <custom-processor>SOLUTION</custom-processor> and contains <custom-processor>SOLUTION</custom-processor> functions
        such as analysis type and options, loads, load step options, and
        solution execution.</li>
        <li><custom-processor>General Postproc</custom-processor> – Enters the general postprocessor and
        contains <custom-processor>POST1</custom-processor> functions such as plotting and listing of results.</li>
        <li><custom-processor>TimeHist Postpro</custom-processor> – Enters the time-history postprocessor and
        loads the Time History Variable Viewer. Contains <custom-processor>POST26</custom-processor> functions
        such as defining, listing, and plotting of variables.</li>
    </ul>

    <sub-heading>Additional Main Menu Utilities</sub-heading><br>
    The default main menu also contains the following dialog boxes that
    are available at any time during the analysis:
    <ul>
        <li><custom-process>Session Editor</custom-process> – Opens the session editor</li>
        <li><custom-process>Finish</custom-process> – Exits the current processor and moves to the Begin level by
        executing the <custom-process>FINISH</custom-process> command.</li>
    </ul>
    <sub-heading>1.5.2.6 The Graphics Window</sub-heading><br>
    The Graphics Window is where all graphics displays are drawn and all
    graphical picking is done. It is usually the largest of the GUI windows.
    Maintain the 4:3 width-to-height proportion while changing the size of the
    Graphics Window. Graphics displays are drawn in the Graphics window when
    a plot is requested. In addition, graphics displays that are generated by
    immediate mode and XOR mode will be seen.<br>
    <custom-spacing>Immediate Mode</custom-spacing><br>
    An immediate mode plot is one that is drawn automatically when the
    analyst creates, moves, reflects, or otherwise manipulates the model. It is
    only a temporary graphics display meant to give immediate feedback on the
    function just executed. As a result, an immediate mode plot has two
    drawbacks:
    1. It will be destroyed if a menu or a dialog is brought up on top of it or if
    the GUI is iconified and restored.
    2. Its scaling is based on the scaling for the last plot request, so if the
    new entity lies <custom-style>“outside”</custom-style>the boundaries of that scaled image, it will not
    appear in the Graphics Window. Issue a plot request to see the new
    entity.<br>
    Numbers and symbols drawn in immediate mode have a similar
    drawback: they will disappear when a plot is requested unless they are
    explicitly set to <custom-style>“on”</custom-style> via the appropriate functions under the <custom-process>PlotCtrls</custom-process> menu.
    Immediate mode can be turned off using the <custom-process>Immediate Display</custom-process> function
    under <custom-process>Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> Erase Options</custom-process>.<br>
    If a plot is requested <custom-style>“manually”</custom-style>, the program calculates the graphics
    scaling such that the display fills the window. This is more of a
    <custom-style>“permanent”</custom-style> display in that it stays in place even if it is obscured by a dialog
    box or a menu or if the Graphics Window is iconified and then restored.<br>
    <custom-spacing>XOR Mode</custom-spacing><br>
    The program uses this mode when something needs to be drawn or
    erased quickly without destroying whatever is currently being displayed in the
    Graphics Window. For example, XOR mode takes effect during graphical
    picking to highlight or unhighlight the item being picked. It is also used to
    display the working plane and for rubber-banding.<br>
    The advantage of using XOR mode is that it produces an instantaneous
    display without affecting the existing plot on the screen. The only drawback is
    that drawing in the same location a second time erases the display. For
    example, picking the same node or keypoint a second time erases the
    highlight. Similarly, with the working plane display on, requesting another plot
    without erasing the screen erases the working plane.<br>
    <custom-spacing>Capture Image Feature</custom-spacing><br>
    A useful feature that permits to create <custom-style>“snapshots”</custom-style> of the Graphics
    Window is the <custom-process>Capture Image</custom-process> function (using the <custom-process>Capture Image</custom-process> button in
    the Standard Toolbar or <custom-process>Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> Capture Image</custom-process>). After an
    image is captured, it can be saved to a file and then restored in any session.
    Captured images are useful for comparing different views, sets of results, or
    other significant images simultaneously on the screen.<br>
    <custom-spacing>Mouse Functionality</custom-spacing><br>
    Pressing the scroll wheel button (Fig. 1.26) is the same as a middle
    mouse button.<br>
    Picking Entities:
    Left Button: Picks an entity. Picking is cumulative, so it is not necessary to
    press control or shift to pick more than one entity. Click and hold the button,
    then move the cursor around until the entity under consideration is
    highlighted. When the button is released the highlighted entity will be
    selected.<br>
    Middle Button: Completes a selection. This is like clicking <custom-process>“Apply”</custom-process> in the
    picking dialog (also called <custom-style>“the picker”</custom-style>).<br>
    Right Button: Toggles back and forth between <custom-style>“pick”</custom-style> and <custom-style>“unpick”</custom-style> mode.

    Right Button: Click and drag the right button to zoom in using a window.
    Rolling the scroll wheel also zooms in and out.<br>

    When the right button is clicked in the graphics area a pop-up menu
    with some very common graphics functions appears (Fig. 1.27) . ANSYS does
    not always refresh the graphics screen so <custom-process>Replot</custom-process> is very handy. <custom-process>Fit</custom-process> makes the
    whole model visible. <custom-process>Zoom Back</custom-process> will go back to the view the way it was just
    before zooming in. Along with some of the standard <custom-process>Pan-Zoom-Rotate</custom-process>
    functions, the analyst can also access many of the window control functions
    found in the <custom-process>PlotCrtrls</custom-process> section of the Utility Menu. Placing the cursor over the
    legend areas of the Graphics Window channels the context to access the
    legend control menus.<br>

    messages. It is usually positioned behind the GUI, but it can be raised to the
    front when necessary.<br>
    <custom-spacing>Sizing and Positioning the Output Window on Windows Systems</custom-spacing><br>
    The size and position of the Output Window can be saved using:
    1. Move the window to the desired location
    2. Size the window to the desired dimensions
    3. Select <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Save Menu Layout</custom-process>.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.5.2.8 Creating, Modifying and Positioning Toolbars</sub-heading><br>
    When a session is begun, the start up routine reads a number of text
    files and scripts that set parameters and conditions for the session. Many of
    these files can be modified to provide a more customized level of operation.
    The start160.ans file is one such file. Call up toolbars, set their position
    and define their content in a similar fashion.<br>

    <custom-heading level="2">1.6 Graphical Picking</custom-heading level='2'><br>
    Many functions in the ANSYS program involve graphical picking - using
    the mouse to identify model entities and coordinate locations. There are three
    types of graphical picking operations:
    <ul>
        <li><custom-style>Locational</custom-style> picking, where the coordinates of a new point are located.</li>
        <li><custom-style>Retrieval</custom-style> picking, where existing entities are identified for subsequent
        operations.</li>
        <li><custom-style>Query</custom-style> picking, where points are identified on the model for querying
        data.</li>
    </ul>
    <custom-spacing>Mouse Button Assignments for Picking</custom-spacing><br>
    Mouse button assignments during any picking operation are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>The left button picks or unpicks the entity or location closest to the
        mouse pointer. When this button is pressed, the analyst can cross-
        examine the entity numbers before they are picked, and thus
        query data. Press and drag the left mouse button to preview the
        item being picked or unpicked.</li>
        <li>The middle button (shift-right button on a two-button mouse) is
        the same as the <custom-process>Apply</custom-process> button on the picker. A number of items
        can be picked, and no operations will take effect until <custom-process>Apply</custom-process> or
        <custom-process>OK</custom-process> is pressed. If there are no items currently picked, the middle
        button closes the picker.</li>
        <li>The right button toggles between pick and unpick mode. This
        button is the same as the <custom-process>Pick</custom-process> and <custom-process>Unpick</custom-process> toggle buttons on the
        picking menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <custom-spacing>Hot Spots</custom-spacing><br>
    Hot spots are the locations on an entity that identify it for retrieval
    picking. For example, if two elements are adjacent, the element that is picked
    is the one whose hot spot is closest to the mouse pointer. For areas, volumes,
    and elements, the hot spot is at a location near the centroid. Lines have three
    hot spots: one in the middle and one near each end.<br>
    If the hot spots of two or more entities are coincident, picking the
    coincident entities brings up a <custom-process>"Multiple Entities"</custom-process> dialog box (Fig. 1.29). Press
    the <custom-process>Next</custom-process> or <custom-process>Prev</custom-process> button to <custom-style>"cycle through"</custom-style> the coincident entities until the
    desired entity is highlighted. Then click <custom-process>OK</custom-process> to pick that entity.<br>

    <image-tag>Fig. 1.29 Multiple Entities Dialog Box</image-tag><br>

    <sub-heading>1.6.1 Locational and Retrieval Picking</sub-heading><br>
    Whenever graphical picking (clicking on a menu topic ending with
    the + symbol) is used, the GUI brings up a picking menu, sometimes known
    as the picker. Figure 1.30 shows the picking menus for locational and retrieval
    picking. In this example, creating keypoints by picking their locations on the
    working plane is a locational picking operation, and picking those keypoints to
    apply a load on them is a retrieval picking operation.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="32.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.30 Picking Menus for Locational and Retrieval Picking</image-tag><br>
    <ul>
        <li><custom-process>Function Title</custom-process> - Identifies the function being performed.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Pick Mode</custom-process> - Allows to pick or unpick a location or entity. Either these
        toggle buttons or the right mouse button can be used to switch
        between pick and unpick modes. The mouse pointer is shown as an up
        arrow for picking and a down arrow for unpicking.</li>
        For retrieval picking, choose among single, box, polygon, circle, and
        loop mode. In single pick mode, each click on the mouse picks one entity.
        With box, polygon, and circle modes, press and drag the mouse to enclose a
        set of entities in a box, polygon, or circle.<br>
        Loop mode is available for picking lines and areas only. With loop
        mode, when the analyst picks on a line, then the complete set of lines (or
        areas) defining a continuous loop including that line is also picked. This
        feature is useful when it is necessary to identify continuous lines in order to
        make an area. For all modes of retrieval picking, ANSYS shows the picked
        entities highlighted for visual clarity.<br>
        <li><custom-process>Pick Status</custom-process> - Shows the number of items picked ("Count") and the
        minimum and maximum number of picks required for the function.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Picked Data</custom-process> - Shows information about the item being picked. For
        locational picking, the working plane and global Cartesian coordinates
        of the point are shown. For retrieval picking, this area shows the entity
        number. This data can be seen by pressing and dragging the mouse in
        the graphics area. This allows to preview the information before
        releasing the mouse button and picking the item.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Keyboard Entry Options</custom-process> - In some cases, it may be necessary to
        enter the required data by keyboard in the picker. For example, to
        specify a known coordinate location during locational picking, it may be
        easier to enter the coordinates than to use the mouse. In that case,
        the analyst can choose between working plane coordinates and global
        Cartesian coordinates. For retrieval picking, choose between entering a
        list of entity numbers (such as 1,21,343,...) and a range of numbers
        (such as 1,21,2).</li>
        <li><custom-process>Action Buttons</custom-process> - This area of the menu contains buttons that take
        action on the picked entities, as follows:
        <custom-process>OK</custom-process> - Applies the picked items to execute the function and closes the picking
        menu.<br>
        <custom-process>Apply</custom-process> - Applies the picked items to execute the function but does not close
        the picking menu. Use this button on the menu or stay in the graphics area
        and click the middle mouse button to apply.<br>
        <custom-process>Reset</custom-process> - Unpicks all picked entities and restores the menu and the graphics
        area to their state at the last Apply.<br>
        <custom-process>Cancel</custom-process> - Cancels the function and closes the picking menu.<br>
        <custom-process>Pick All</custom-process> - Picks all entities, executes the selected function, and closes the
        picking menu. This feature is available for retrieval picking only.<br>
        <custom-process>Help</custom-process> - Brings up help information for the function being performed.</li>
    </ul>
    <sub-heading>1.6.2 Query Picking</sub-heading><br>
    The picker can be used to <custom-style>"Query"</custom-style> data on the model at any time
    during the analysis. Querying means that, for any picked point on the model,
    ANSYS will retrieve or calculate specified items from the database and display
    them. This information can be displayed in an output window, or it can be
    applied to the model as 3-D annotation. Query picking is a retrieval picking
    function, with the selection box items varying according to the requested
    data. The model and results query pickers are discussed in the following
    sections.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.6.2.1 The Model Query Picker</sub-heading><br>
    The model query picker allows to access model information by picking
    displayed entities. It also performs basic computations to provide simple
    geometric/loading information. The model query picker can be used to obtain
    information about the model while building it. This is helpful when building on
    to an existing model, or for applying forces or loads that are dependent on
    the model data. The model query picker can be accessed by choosing <custom-process>Utility
    Menu> List> Picked Entities</custom-process>, at any time during the analysis.<br>
    <custom-spacing>Annotation</custom-spacing><br>
    When the model query picker is used to obtain model information,
    ANSYS displays the information in a text window. That information can also
    be applied to the model as 3-D annotation by checking the <custom-process>"Generate 3D
    Anno"</custom-process> box on the picker. The annotation is applied with the appropriate units
    displayed, and arrows and leaders are attached where necessary. 3-D
    annotation, unlike 2-D, will attempt to retain the proper positioning on the
    appropriate entities, even when the model is rotated or resized.<br>
    The overall 3-D dimensions of the model are defined by a bounding
    box. If portions of the model's bounding box lie outside of the visible area of
    the graphics window, it can affect the placement of the 3-D annotations.
    Zooming out will usually overcome this problem.<br>
    Modify query annotation using <custom-process>Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> Annotation>
    Create 3D Annotation</custom-process>. Select <custom-process>"Options"</custom-process> to modify the typeface and move,
    copy, or resize the annotation.<br>
    <custom-spacing>Action Buttons</custom-spacing><br>
    <ul>
        <li><custom-process>OK</custom-process> - Enters all query data and either displays it in a window or applies
        it to the model. The model query picker is then closed.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Apply</custom-process> - Enters all query data and displays it in a window or applies it to
        the model. The model query picker is left open for additionals
        operations.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Reset</custom-process> - Clears all query data.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Cancel</custom-process> - Clears all query data and closes the model query picker.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Pick All</custom-process> - Accesses all of the selected query items on the model.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Help</custom-process> - Brings up this screen of help information.</li>
    </ul>
    <custom-spacing>Tips on Using the Model Query Picker</custom-spacing><br>
    The model query picker is accessible at any time during the analysis. It
    is useful for determining model database information that would require hand
    calculations to determine. The computations performed by the picker are not
    displayed until <custom-process>OK</custom-process> or <custom-process>APPLY</custom-process> is pressed.<br>
    The items selected by the picker are highlighted before they are
    actually selected. Hold the left mouse button down and move the pointer
    around the model to ensure that the proper entity is selected. The analyst can
    select multiple items, with no computations being performed or annotation
    applied until <custom-process>OK</custom-process> is clicked. The commands and operations performed by the
    model query picker are not written to the log file.<br>
    The annotation that is generated during the preprocessing stage can
    be displayed at any time during the analysis. This information is not modified
    or updated during the course of the analysis, and can become invalid. For
    instance, when a shape is deformed by the applied forces, the area and
    volume annotations created before applying the force will not change, and
    the information displayed may be incorrect.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.6.2.2 The Results Query Picker</sub-heading><br>
    The most convenient way to review results for specific points on the
    model is by using the results query picker. Querying means that, for any
    picked point on the model, the ANSYS program will retrieve a specified results
    data value from the database and display it. Access the results query picker
    by choosing <custom-process>Main Menu> General Postproc> Query Results</custom-process>. The analyst can
    query nodal or element solution data.<br>
    When this GUI path is choosen, the results query picker for element
    solution data appears. This menu has most of the same items as the
    locational and retrieval picking menus:
    <ul>
        <li><custom-process>Function Title</custom-process> - Identifies the information being queried; either nodal,
        element, or subgrid solution data.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Pick Mode</custom-process> - Allows to pick or unpick a location on the model to be
        queried. These toggle buttons or the right mouse button can be used
        to switch between pick and unpick modes. The mouse pointer is shown
        as an up arrow for picking and a down arrow for unpicking.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Picked Location</custom-process> - Shows the number and location of the node,
        element, or subgrid point being picked for query. This information can
        be previewed by pressing and dragging the mouse in the graphics
        area. The picked location is highlighted on the model as a square on
        the displaced shape.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Queried Data</custom-process> - Shows the queried solution data for the node, element,
        or subgrid point at the picked location. Use the <custom-process>Max</custom-process> or <custom-process>Min</custom-process> buttons to
        automatically obtain the maximum or minimum value of the query data
        over the entire model.</li>
    </ul>
    <custom-spacing>Annotation</custom-spacing><br>
    The results query picker retrieves solution data from the database and
    displays it in a text window. That information can be applied to the model as
    3-D annotation by selecting the <custom-process>“Generate 3D Anno”</custom-process> box on the picker. The
    annotation is applied with the appropriate units displayed, and arrows and
    leaders are attached where necessary. The overall 3-D dimensions of the
    model are defined by a bounding box. If portions of the model's bounding box
    lie outside of the visible area of the graphics window, it can affect the
    placement of the 3-D annotations. Zooming out will usually overcome this
    problem. Unlike the model query picker, the results query picker displays the
    actual data on the model as the mouse pointer is moved over the different
    entities. This function is available only from the <custom-processor>General Postprocessor</custom-processor>.<br>
    <custom-spacing>Action Buttons</custom-spacing><br>
    <ul>
        <li><custom-process>OK</custom-process> - Clears all query data and closes the results query picker.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Apply</custom-process> - Clears all query data and brings up the Query Solution Data
        dialog box again. This button can be used on the picking menu or stay
        in the graphics area and click the middle mouse button to achieve the
        same effect.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Reset</custom-process> - Clears all query data.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Cancel</custom-process> - Clears all query data and closes the query picking menu.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Min</custom-process> - Shows the minimum value of the query data over the entire
        model.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Max</custom-process> - Shows the maximum value of the query data over the entire
        model.</li>
        <li><custom-process>Help</custom-process> - Brings up this screen of help information.</li>
    </ul>
    <custom-heading level="2">1.7 Customizing the GUI</custom-heading level='2'><br>
    The GUI allows several levels of customization, ranging from a simple
    change in the sizes of the GUI and the areas in it to a more complex change
    in the menu hierarchy and design of the dialog boxes. GUI attributes which
    can be changed include the following items:
    <ul>
        <li>The size of the GUI and the areas in it</li>
        <li>Colors and fonts</li>
        <li>The menus shown at GUI start-up</li>
        <li>The mouse and keyboard focus</li>
        <li>The menu hierarchy and dialog boxes.</li>
    </ul>
    <sub-heading>1.7.1 Changing the GUI Layout</sub-heading><br>
    The ANSYS toolbar, Main Menu, and Graphics Window, as well as the
    overall size of the GUI can be resized. To resize the areas in the GUI, drag
    one of the borders around the areas of the GUI while holding down the left
    mouse button.<br>
    In order to change the overall size of the GUI, position the mouse on
    one of the corners of the GUI and drag it diagonally toward the center of the
    GUI while holding down the left mouse button. GUI size settings can be saved
    by selecting <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Save Menu Layout</custom-process>.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.7.2 Changing Colors and Fonts</sub-heading><br>
    The system-level fonts determine the default ANSYS GUI font
    component. ANSYS uses the fonts that are set at the <custom-process>Display
    Properties</custom-process> system level. The fonts in the ANSYS GUI are based on the system
    font settings. Use the <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Font</custom-process> dialog to modify the
    GUI fonts. Once these settings are changed, use the <custom-process>Utility Menu>
    MenuCtrls> Save Menu Layout</custom-process> to save the settings. The saved settings will
    override the system fonts and become the ANSYS default.<br>
    The Main Menu fonts can also be modified by using the <custom-process>“right mouse
    button”</custom-process> - preferences function. At this level, specific fonts and colors are set
    in the Main Menu at a functional level. The analyst can change the overall
    fonts, and change the colors according to the progressive level as s/he opens
    the nested menu items.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.7.3 Changing the GUI Components Shown at Start-Up</sub-heading><br>
    By default, the main areas of the GUI (Utility Menu, Main Menu,
    Standard Toolbar, ANSYS Toolbar, Input Window, Graphics Window, and
    Output Window) display when the GUI is activated.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.7.4 Changing the Mouse and Keyboard Focus</sub-heading><br>
    The ANSYS program uses the concept of input focus to determine
    which window on the screen is active; that is, which window receives input
    from the mouse and the keyboard. A window may have implicit focus (also
    known as pointer focus), in which case moving the mouse pointer into that
    window makes it active. With explicit focus, it is necessary to move the
    pointer into the window and click the left button for that window to be active.<br>
    The ANSYS GUI also gives automatic keyboard focus to the Input
    Window. This means a command can be entered without first moving the
    mouse into the Input Window. If a dialog box is brought up, then keyboard
    focus is automatically redirected to it so the analyst can enter data without
    moving the mouse. This feature is sometimes called the <custom-style>hot keyboard</custom-style> feature.<br>
    <custom-heading level="2">1.8 Using the ANSYS Session and Command Logs</custom-heading level='2'><br>
    The ANSYS program records every command it executes, at two
    places: the session log file and the internal database command log.<br>
    The session log file is a text file which is saved in the working directory.
    The database command log is saved in the ANSYS database. This log can be
    copied to a file at any time by choosing <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Write DB Log
    File</custom-process>. Both files are command logs that can be used as input to the ANSYS
    program.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.8.1 Session Log File</sub-heading><br>
    Every ANSYS session produces a session log named Jobname.LOG.
    Jobname is determined by the jobname defined at ANSYS entry. The default
    jobname is <custom-style>FILE</custom-style> or file, depending on the operating system. The program
    opens the log file when the analyst first enters the program, and closes it
    when s/he exits the program.<br>
    The session log file provides a complete record of the ANSYS session in
    terms of commands and is quite valuable as a means of recovering from a
    system crash or catastrophic user mistake. By reading in a renamed copy of
    the log file or by submitting it as a batch file, the s/he can re-execute every
    command in the log file, recreating the database exactly as it existed
    previously. The log file is also useful as a debugging tool that can help to
    reveal any mistakes that might have been made in an ANSYS session.<br>
    Each new ANSYS session appends commands to the existing
    file Jobname.LOG. That is, the log file is not overwritten during a new ANSYS
    session, but added to. A <custom-style>"time stamp,"</custom-style> consisting of the current date and
    time, is included so that the analyst can identify the start of each session. The
    entire log file can be listed during an interactive run by picking <custom-process>Utility Menu>
    List> Files> Log File</custom-process>. Because this file is in ASCII format, it can be viewed
    and edited readily using an external text editor.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.8.2 Using the Database Command Log</sub-heading><br>
    ANSYS captures commands generated during an ANSYS session not
    only in the log file but also in memory. This in-memory version of the
    command history is called the internal database log. When the database is
    saved, the program saves this command log in the database file
    (Jobname.DB) along with the other database information.<br>
    Use <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Write DB Log File</custom-process> to write the database
    command log to a named ASCII file. Then edit this file, make desired
    changes, and use the file as command input to the program. This capability is
    especially useful to use the command history that was created during an
    interactive session, but have somehow lost or corrupted the session log file
    (Jobname.LOG) that was associated with the database.<br>
    If the database is created in multiple sessions by saving and resuming
    the database file, the ANSYS program keeps the database log continuous by
    appending each new command that is processed. Therefore, the internal
    database log is not fragmented; it will represent the complete database.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.8.3 Command Log File as Input</sub-heading><br>
    The procedure for re-executing the commands contained in
    a Jobname.LOG file or in the database log consists of three main steps:
    1. Establish the command log file
    2. Edit the command log file as desired
    3. Read the edited file into the ANSYS session.<br>
    <custom-spacing><b>Step 1: Establish the Command Log File</b></custom-spacing><br>
    The method to do this depends on whether the analyst uses the
    session log file or the database log.<br>
